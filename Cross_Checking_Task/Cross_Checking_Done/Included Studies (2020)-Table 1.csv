9,640,1,"Youth Mental Health First Aid USA (YMHFA) is a manualized training program designed to educate members of the public on common emotional problems and psychological disorders among youth and to provide trainees with tools anyone can use to assist young people in psychological distress. The present study used a pre versus post design to assess the ability of social service employees to generate appropriate strategies to use in hypothetical situations featuring a young person in distress, before versus after participation in the 8-hr YMHFA training. Trainee responses demonstrated significant overall improvement (M = 1.32, SD = 0.80 pretraining vs. M = 1.87, SD = 1.1 posttraining, t = 6.6, p &lt; .001) by including four of the five central YMHFA strategies significantly more often after training. Increased confidence in, likelihood of, and comfort with helping a young person in emotional distress or crisis were also reported posttraining compared to pretraining (all p ≤ .001). Results suggest that individuals participating in YMHFA training are better informed regarding when to assess for risk of suicide, listen nonjudgmentally, encourage appropriate professional help, and encourage self-help strategies with young people in psychological distress.

9,641,4,"Background: Pulmonary and critical care physicians routinely make complex decisions, but little is known about cognitive aspects of this process. Omission bias and status quo bias are well-descibed cognitive biases that can cause lay decision makers to prefer inaction that preserves the status quo even when changing the status quo through action is more likely, to lead to the best outcomes. It is unknown if these biases influence trained decision makers such as pulmonologists.Study objectives: To determine whether omission bias and status quo bias influence the medical decisions of pulmonologists.Design and interventions: The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted within a cross-sectional survey of pulmonologists' opinions about the relevance of various factors in pulmonary and critical care decision making. We designed case vignettes that presented patient information with an associated patient management choice. The status quo state and the action/omission distinction were varied in two forms of otherwise identical vignettes. One form of each case vignette pair (A and B) was administered randomly to each prospective respondent during the first mailing of the opinion survey.Participants: Five hundred pulmonologists selected randomly from the membership of the American College of Chest Physicians,Measurements and results: There were 125 respondents, including 59 for form A and 66 form B (enrollment rate, 25%). In vignettes involving evaluation of pulmonary embolism and treatment of septic shock, respondents were more likely to choose a suboptimal management strategy when an omission option was present that allowed preservation of the status quo (71% vs 53%, p = 0.048; 50% vs 29%, p = 0.016, respectively). In a vignette involving a hypothetical clinical trial and the decision to prescribe tube feeding, the omission option was not significantly associated with the decision to prescribe tube feeding (54% vs 50%, p = 0.67).Conclusion: Pulmonary and critical care decisions are susceptible to the influence of omission and status quo bias. Because of the great number of decisions that are made each day involving choices between maintaining or changing the status quo, this finding could have far-reaching implications for patient outcomes, cost-effectiveness, resource utilization, clinical practice variability, and medical errors.",Aberegg,2005,Omission bias and decision making in pulmonary and critical care medicine,CHEST,128,1497,1505,Web of Science,"Aberegg, SK; Haponik, EF; Terry, PB"
9,642,4,"Background. Physicians are slow to adopt novel therapies, and the reasons for this are poorly understood. The authors sought to determine if the size of the treatment effect of a novel therapy influences willingness to adopt it. Methods. We developed 2 experimental vignette pairs describing a trial of a therapy for a hypothetical disease that showed a statistically significant mortality benefit. The size of the mortality effect was varied in vignettes of a pair (3% v. 10%). The 2 experimental vignette pairs differed in whether study enrollment was reported. Vignettes were mailed to a random sample of physicians using an intersubject design. The main study outcome was respondents’ willingness to adopt the hypothetical therapy, based on the results of the hypothetical trial. Results. There were 124 and 89 respondents to vignette pairs 1 and 2, respectively. In vignette pair 1, 91% versus 71% of respondents adopted the therapy when it reduced mortality by 10% and 3%, respectively ( P = 0.0058). For vignette pair 2, 88% versus 51% of respondents adopted the therapy when it reduced mortality by 10% and 3%, respectively ( P = 0.0002). In both vignette pairs, nonadopters were more likely than adopters to report side effects of the therapy as a principal reason for their decision. Conclusions. In this study, respondents were less likely to adopt a lifesaving therapy if its associated mortality reduction was 3% compared to 10%. Because most therapies for major medical conditions reduce mortality within or below this range, and because there were no opportunity costs associated with the adoption of the therapy, we believe that this effect represents a bias. Further investigation will be required to determine its prevalence and mechanism.

9,644,4,"Sixty therapists randomly assigned to 1 of 2 priming conditions were primed with African American stereotypes or neutral words using 80-ms flash words on a computer screen. This procedure may activate information processing outside of conscious awareness. After this task, participants were exposed to a brief vignette introducing Mr. X, a patient referred for treatment, and then were asked to rate Mr. X on various dimensions. Results indicate that participants primed with stereotype words rated Mr. X significantly less favorably on hostility-related attributes and significantly more favorably on hostility-unrelated attributes than did participants primed with neutral words. The findings suggest that therapists can be affected by African American stereotypes in ways that produce negative or positive first impressions depending on the nature of the attribute that is rated.

9,645,9,"The aim of this study was to initiate the exploration of debiasing methods applicable in real-life settings for achieving lasting improvement in decision making competence regarding multiple decision biases. Here, we tested the potentials of the analogical encoding method for decision debiasing. The advantage of this method is that it can foster the transfer from learning abstract principles to improving behavioral performance. For the purpose of the study, we devised an analogical debiasing technique for 10 biases (covariation detection, insensitivity to sample size, base rate neglect, regression to the mean, outcome bias, sunk cost fallacy, framing effect, anchoring bias, overconfidence bias, planning fallacy) and assessed the susceptibility of the participants (N = 154) to these biases before and 4 weeks after the training. We also compared the effect of the analogical training to the effect of 'awareness training' and a 'no-training' control group. Results suggested improved performance of the analogical training group only on tasks where the violations of statistical principles are measured. The interpretation of these findings require further investigation, yet it is possible that analogical training may be the most effective in the case of learning abstract concepts, such as statistical principles, which are otherwise difficult to master. The study encourages a systematic research of debiasing trainings and the development of intervention assessment methods to measure the endurance of behavior change in decision debiasing.",Aczel,2015,Is it time for studying real-life debiasing?

9,646,4,"Background: Delayed cancer diagnosis leads to poorer patient outcomes. During short consultations, General Practitioners (GPs) make quick decisions about likelihood of cancer. Patients' facial cues are processed rapidly and may influence diagnosis. Aim: To investigate whether patients' facial characteristics influence immediate perception of cancer risk by GPs. Design and setting: Web-based binary forced choice experiment with GPs from Northeast Scotland. Method: GPs were presented with a series of pairs of face prototypes and asked to quickly select the patient more likely to have cancer. Faces were modified with respect to age, gender, and ethnicity. Choices were analysed using Chi-squared goodness-of-fit statistics with Bonferroni corrections. Results: Eighty-two GPs participated. GPs were significantly more likely to suspect cancer in older patients. Gender influenced GP cancer suspicion, but this was modified by age: the male face was chosen as more likely to have cancer than the female face for young (72% of GPs;95% CI 61.0−87.0) and middle-aged faces (65.9%; 95% CI 54.7−75.5); but 63.4% (95% CI 52.2−73.3) decided the older female was more likely to have cancer than the older male (p = 0.015). GPs were significantly more likely to suspect cancer in the young Caucasian male (65.9% (95% CI 54.7, 75.5)) compared to the young Asian male (p = 0.004). Conclusion: GPs' first impressions about cancer risk are influenced by patient age, gender, and ethnicity. Tackling GP cognitive biases could be a promising way of reducing cancer diagnostic delays, particularly for younger patients.

9,647,9,"Anchoring bias is a decision heuristic evidenced by skewed estimates made after an initial value is considered. The anchoring heuristic is both pervasive and powerful, affecting decision-making processes in many practical contexts. An experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of both preexisting and new training techniques for mitigating anchoring bias, as well as to test a new type of anchoring bias inducing stimuli. Results show that the training module was effective in helping participants mitigate anchoring bias, and that the new stimuli were effective in eliciting anchoring bias in both high and low anchoring conditions. Additionally, the results provide theoretical evidence anchoring is due, at least in part, to semantic priming. Theoretical implications for the semantic priming and the revised adjustment explanation are discussed. Practical considerations for developing effective online and/or game-based training programs to mitigate the effects of overreliance on the anchoring heuristic are also discussed.

9,649,4,"This paper explores differences in how primary care doctors process the clinical presentation of depression by African American and African-Caribbean patients compared with white patients in the US and the UK. The aim is to gain a better understanding of possible pathways by which racial disparities arise in depression care. One hundred and eight doctors described their thought processes after viewing video recorded simulated patients presenting with identical symptoms strongly suggestive of depression. These descriptions were analysed using the CliniClass system, which captures information about micro-components of clinical decision making and permits a systematic, structured and detailed analysis of how doctors arrive at diagnostic, intervention and management decisions. Video recordings of actors portraying black (both African American and African-Caribbean) and white (both White American and White British) male and female patients (aged 55 years and 75 years) were presented to doctors randomly selected from the Massachusetts Medical Society list and from Surrey/South West London and West Midlands National Health Service lists, stratified by country (US v.UK), gender, and years of clinical experience (less v. very experienced). Findings demonstrated little evidence of bias affecting doctors' decision making processes, with the exception of less attention being paid to the potential outcomes associated with different treatment options for African American compared with White American patients in the US. Instead, findings suggest greater clinical uncertainty in diagnosing depression amongst black compared with white patients, particularly in the UK. This was evident in more potential diagnoses. There was also a tendency for doctors in both countries to focus more on black patients' physical rather than psychological symptoms and to identify endocrine problems, most often diabetes, as a presenting complaint for them. This suggests that doctors in both countries have a less well developed mental model of depression for black compared with white patients.

9,650,4,"Background: Nurses caring for the large numbers of people with leg ulceration play a key role in promoting quality in health via their diagnostic and treatment clinical judgements. In the UK, audit evidence suggests that the quality of these judgements is often sub optimal. Misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment choices are likely to affect healing rates, patients’ quality of life, patient safety and healthcare costs. Objectives: To explore the diagnostic judgements and treatment choices of UK community nurses managing venous leg ulceration. Design: A judgement analysis based on Brunswik's psychological Lens Model theory. Setting: UK community and primary care nursing services. Participants: 18 community generalist nurses working in district (home) nursing teams and general practitioner services and 18 community tissue viability specialist nurses. Methods: During 2011 and 2012, 36 nurses made diagnostic judgements and treatment choices in response to 110 clinical scenarios. Scenarios were generated from real patient cases and presented online using text and wound photographs. The consensus judgements of a panel of nurses with advanced knowledge of leg ulceration judged the same scenarios and provided a standard against which to compare the participants. Correlations and logistic regression models were constructed to generate various indices of judgement and decision “performance”: accuracy (R a ), consistency (R s ) and information use (G) and uncertainty (R e ). Results: Taking uncertainty into account, nurses could theoretically have achieved a diagnostic level of accuracy of 0.63 but the nurses only achieved an accuracy of 0.48. For the treatment judgement (whether applying high compression was warranted) nurses could have achieved an accuracy of 0.88 but achieved only an accuracy of 0.49. This may have been due to the nurses giving insufficient weight to the diagnostic cues of medical history and appearance of the leg and ulcer and insufficient weight to the treatment cues of type of leg ulcer and pain. Conclusion: Clinical judgements and decisions made by nurses managing leg ulceration are complex and uncertain and some of the variability in judgements and choices can be explained by the ways in which nurses process the information and handle the uncertainties, present in clinical encounters.

,651,2,"Developed an iterative Bayesian decision aid to give users greater control of the decision-making process and thereby increase the likelihood of aid implementation. The aid permits users to modify the initially assessed likelihood ratios and resulting posterior odds for the hypotheses under consideration until they feel comfortable with the inferred implications of the data. The aid was applied to the area of military tactical intelligence analysis and evaluated experimentally by experienced analysts on a training task representative of that decision-making environment. 12 experienced and 18 inexperienced (but trained) analysts working with the aid were (1) better able to discriminate between the most and least likely hypotheses and (2) assigned final likelihoods to the hypotheses that were more similar to normative likelihoods derived from Bayes's theorem than unaided analysts. In addition, analyses of individual analysts revealed large differences in decision-making strategies. These differences demonstrate that users can approach the inference problem using their own decision-making style, thereby ensuring user control over all stages of the decision-making process.

9,658,4,"Prior research has shown that physicians' medical decisions can be influenced by sequential context, particularly in cases where successive stimuli exhibit similar characteristics when analyzing medical images. This type of systematic error is known to psychophysicists as sequential context effect as it indicates that judgments are influenced by features of and decisions about the preceding case in the sequence of examined cases, rather than being based solely on the peculiarities unique to the present case. We determine if radiologists experience some form of context bias, using screening mammography as the use case. To this end, we explore correlations between previous perceptual behavior and diagnostic decisions and current decisions. We hypothesize that a radiologist's visual search pattern and diagnostic decisions in previous cases are predictive of the radiologist's current diagnostic decisions. To test our hypothesis, we tasked 10 radiologists of varied experience to conduct blind reviews of 100 four-view screening mammograms. Eye-tracking data and diagnostic decisions were collected from each radiologist under conditions mimicking clinical practice. Perceptual behavior was quantified using the fractal dimension of gaze scanpath, which was computed using the Minkowski-Bouligand boxcounting method. To test the effect of previous behavior and decisions, we conducted a multifactor fixed-effects ANOVA. Further, to examine the predictive value of previous perceptual behavior and decisions, we trained and evaluated a predictive model for radiologists' current diagnostic decisions. ANOVA tests showed that previous visual behavior, characterized by fractal analysis, previous diagnostic decisions, and image characteristics of previous cases are significant predictors of current diagnostic decisions. Additionally, predictive modeling of diagnostic decisions showed an overall improvement in prediction error when the model is trained on additional information about previous perceptual behavior and diagnostic decisions.

9,668,4,"Overconfidence has emerged as a significant explanation of behaviour in diverse managerial settings. In this paper, we explore the relevance of overconfidence for supply chain-management by running a series of human experiments within the framework of the classic Beer Game. Unlike previous experimental studies, participants were knowledgeable about supply chain management, either being graduate students in Operations Management or purchasing professionals. Results of the study support the view that overconfidence may lead supply chain professionals to be less careful in the management of inventories and thus incur more costs. A first implication for organizations is that purchasing professionals should be trained to discount their expectations of success by removing this optimistic bias. A second is the importance of providing managers and employees with benchmarks that allow them to assess correctly their performance in relative terms. The study also underlines the effect of environmental uncertainty as an important contextual factor influencing overconfident behaviour. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Also examined were a potential cognitive basis for hindsight bias and whether certain environmental conditions (presence of red flags) facilitate a backward reconstruction (BR) of events. This BR has been argued to magnify the effects of hindsight bias. A behavioral experiment was conducted with 65 federal and state general jurisdiction judges and 58 auditors. Results indicate that judges provided lower evaluations of auditors' performance than did auditors, reflective of an expectation gap. Evaluative judgments of auditors' performance were subject to hindsight bias. Results are consistent with a cognitive interpretation of hindsight bias.

9,670,1,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals are expected to make rapid, correct decisions in critical situations despite what may be a lack of real practical experience in a particular crisis situation. Successful resolution of a medical crisis depends upon demonstration not only of appropriate technical skills but also of key behavioral skills (eg, leadership, communication, and teamwork). We have developed a hands-on, high fidelity, simulation-based training program (ECMO Sim) to provide healthcare professionals with the opportunity to learn and practice the technical and behavioral skills necessary to manage ECMO emergencies.METHODS: Nine ECMO nurse specialists participated in two sequential randomly assigned simulated ECMO emergencies. The simulated emergencies were captured on videotape and reviewed with the subjects during facilitated debriefings that occurred immediately following each scenario. All videotapes were scored for key technical and behavioral skills by reviewers blinded to the sequence of the scenarios. The ratings of the subjects' technical and behavioral skills in each scenario were compared.RESULTS: Subjects performed key technical skills correctly more often in the second simulated ECMO emergency. In addition, their response times for three out of five specific technical tasks improved from the first to the second simulated emergency by an average of 27 seconds. Subjects' behavioral skills were rated more highly by masked reviewers in the second simulated ECMO emergency. The improvement in comprehensive behavioral scores from the first to the second scenario reached statistical significance in eight of nine subjects.CONCLUSION: After exposure to high-fidelity simulated ECMO emergencies, subjects demonstrated significant improvements in their technical and behavioral skills. ECMO Sim creates a learning environment that readily supports the acquisition of the technical and behavioral skills that are important in solving clinically significant, potentially life-threatening problems that can occur when patients are on ECMO.",Anderson,2006,Simulating extracorporeal membrane oxygenation emergencies to improve human performance.

We also collected demographic characteristics and physicians' perceived success rate of TJA in terms of pain relief and functional improvement.RESULTS: There were 149 PCPs (response rate= 61%) who participated. The mean test score was 6.5 +/- 1.5. Only 17% correctly identified the published success rate of TJA (i.e., = 90%). In multivariate analysis, the only physician-related variables associated with test score were ethnicity, board status, and perceived success rate of TJA. Physicians who were white (P=. 001), board-certified (P=. 04), and perceived a higher success rate of TJA (P=. 004) had higher test scores.CONCLUSIONS: PCP knowledge with respect to guideline-concordant care for OA could be improved, specifically in deciding when to consider TJA versus optimizing nonsurgical options.

9,674,9,"Researchers encounter challenges that require making complex professional decisions. Strategies such as seeking help and anticipating consequences support decision-making in these situations. Existing evidence on a measure of professional decision-making in research (the PDR) that assesses the use of decision-making strategies revealed that NIH-funded researchers born outside of the U.S. tended to score below their U.S. counterparts. To examine potential explanations for this association, this study recruited 101 researchers born in the United States and 102 born internationally to complete the PDR and measures of basic personal values, values in scientific work, discrimination between the seriousness of rules in research, exposure to unprofessional research practices, and acculturation to American culture. Several variables were associated with PDR scores-discrimination between types of rules in research, exposure to unprofessional research practices, acculturation, and the basic personal values of power, security, and benevolence. However, only security, benevolence, acculturation, and rule discrimination were also associated with nation of origin. In multivariate models, the variance explained by these variables in accounting for the association of nation of origin and PDR scores was somewhat overlapping, thus, only security and benevolence remained as unique, statistically significant predictors. Thus, this study identified some important variables in the association of nation of origin and PDR, but more research is needed. In a secondary analysis to examine the ""clinical significance"" (the practical importance) of scores on the PDR, this study examined aggregated PDR score data from the present sample and past samples of investigators. This analysis identified scores that may suggest a concern versus those scores that may be interpreted as excellent, proficient, or marginal.

9,677,4,"The participation of forensic psychologists has become common practice in proceedings involving families in dispute over child custody, and also to assess the suitability of joint custody. In order to know the practice, methodology, and decision-making criteria of Spanish forensic psychologists experienced in family cases, 66 Spanish forensic psychologists (error margin +/-.06) responded to a Spanish adaptation of the questionnaire for the assessment of child custody evaluation practices by Keilin and Bloom (1986) and Ackerman and Ackerman (1997). The results showed that it was indifferent for the respondents to be retained by the court or one of the parties, and that the evaluation included a document review, each parent's individual interview, each child's individual interview, psychological tests run to parents and children, observation of parent-child interaction, and reports by other professionals. As regards the custody type, most of them chose sole custody. As for decision-making criteria for sole custody, the results showed that Spanish forensic psychologists follow a hierarchical decision-making model that begins, firstly, with the application of criteria concerning the child's protection (e.g. cruelty, abuse, negligence), then moving on to parental abilities.

9,678,4,"Objective: To assess and compare management preferences of physicians for moderate and severe acute asthma based on case scenarios and to determine the factors influencing their decisions. Methods: A questionnaire based on the Global Initiative on Asthma (GINA) guideline and comprising eight questions on management of acute asthma was delivered to participants of two national pediatric congresses. Management of moderate and severe acute asthma cases was evaluated by two clinical case scenarios for estimation of acute attack severity, initial treatment, treatment after 1h, and discharge recommendations. A uniform answer box comprising the possible choices was provided just below the questions, and respondents were requested to tick the answers they thought was appropriate. Results: Four-hundred and eighteen questionnaires were analyzed. All questions regarding moderate and severe acute asthma case scenarios were answered accurately by 15.8% and 17.0% of physicians, respectively. The initial treatment of moderate and severe cases was known by 100.0% and 78.2% of physicians, respectively. Knowledge of the appropriate plan for treatment after 1h was low both for moderate (45.0%) and severe attacks (35.4%). Discharge recommendations were adequate in 32.5% and 70.8% of physicians for moderate and severe attacks, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that working at a hospital with a continuing medical education program was the only significant predictor of a correct response to all questions regarding severe attacks ( p = .04; 95%CI, 1.02–3.21). No predictors were found for information on moderate attacks. Conclusions: Pediatricians have difficulty in planning treatment after 1 hour both for moderate and severe asthma attacks.

The survey consisted of 3 sections including background demographics, 14 knowledge assessment (KA) questions and opinions on educational needs. Results: Two hundred and twenty-five surveys were received from physicians and medical students, of which 189 were completed and analysed. The overall mean score on the KA section was 31.4 +/- 18.3% (4.4 +/- 2.6 of 14 questions) correct.

A nonexperimental, descriptive study was conducted. Five hundred ED nurses were randomly selected to receive a mailed clinical vignette questionnaire. Data analysis included descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. ED nurses perceived the middle-aged male vignette patient to be in need of more urgent triage (t = 2.58; df= 207; p = 0.01) and an admission to an intensive care unit bed (χ² = 10.43; df = 1; p = 0.001) and were more likely to consider a cardiac diagnosis in the male than the age-matched female (χ² = 37.49; df = 1 ; p &lt; 0.0001) with identical presentation. However, no such differences were noted in the elderly vignette patients. The findings of this study suggest that gender bias and ageism may account for the disparities in triage decisions for middle-aged women with complaints suggestive of coronary artery disease.

The presence of a single misleading detail may lead clinicians down a cognitive and actual path toward an incorrect diagnosis. Methods: In a large teaching hospital, we surveyed 51 attending doctors in internal medicine, presenting each with 10 clinical vignettes and soliciting their diagnosis of the condition leading to the presentation. Each of the 10 clinical cases included a single misleading detail. Results: This survey elicited a wrong diagnosis in 90% of cases, which was reduced to 30% when omitting the misleading detail from the vignette. Diagnostic accuracy did not improve by warning doctors about potentially misleading information. Asking doctors to identify a leading diagnostic detail and then to formulate an alternative diagnosis after omission of the detail, significantly reduced diagnostic error rate by nearly 50%.

In observational training, observers are presented with a category label and then shown an exemplar from that category. In feedback training, they are shown an exemplar, asked to assign it to a category, and then given feedback about the accuracy of their response. These two types of training were compared as observers learned two types of category structures-those in which optimal accuracy could be achieved via some explicit rule-based strategy, and those in which optimal accuracy required integrating information from separate perceptual dimensions at some predecisional stage. There was an overall advantage for feedback training over observational training, but most importantly, type of training interacted strongly with type of category structure. With rule-based structures, the effects of training type were small, but with information-integration structures, accuracy was substantially higher with feedback training, and people were less likely to use suboptimal rule-based strategies.

9,685,9,"Performance on perceptual tasks usually improves with training. However, too much consecutive training can be detrimental. Repeated within-day testing or overtraining demonstrates the detrimental effects this has on perceptual learning. Consolidation of learnt information during sleep has the power to prevent such deficits in learning. However, little is known regarding the role of wakeful consolidation in preventing the effects of overtraining. Here, we report that perceptual deterioration may result from the disruption of early wakeful consolidation processes. Three groups were tested on day 1 and again 24 h later, on a motion discrimination task. Participants who had a 1 h break between the two training sessions on the first day displayed improved accuracy on the second day (i.e. learning). Subjects who only completed the first training session on day 1 also exhibited learning. However, individuals who completed two blocks without a break ('overtraining') showed no improvement in accuracy on day 2. Interestingly, changes in reaction times were not susceptible to the effects of overtraining, but instead speeded up as a function of total performed trials.

Supporting evidence was found in an experiment with 61 experienced criminal investigators. First, when judging the reliability of a witness statement, sad participants relied on their perception of both witness and situational variables, whereas angry participants relied only on their perception of witness variables. This corresponds to the emphasis placed on situational and individual control in the appraisals associated with sadness and anger, respectively. Second, when making judgments of the case, sad participants were sensitive to the consistency of a witness statement with the central hypothesis of the investigation, indicating substantive processing, whereas angry participants were unaffected by statement-hypothesis consistency, indicating heuristic processing.

Qualitative methods were used in this study and the data was collected from 100 pediatric nurses using a demographic data form and an open-ended questionnaire. The demographic data form included questions about the characteristics of nurses and their participation in decisions made about ethical issues. Whereas the open-ended questionnaire consisted of questions regarding sample cases, which were developed by the investigators using current literature. Forty-four percent of the pediatric nurses reported an attempt to solve ethical issues that they encountered through their professional experiences using personal values. On the other hand, 53 % of the pediatric nurses stated that their decisions were sometimes taken into consideration in the treatment plan of their own patients, while 49 % reported that they could not participate in decision-making regarding patients’ discharge. Seventy-six percent of the pediatric nurses did not define the ethical issues in the three sample cases. However, in other cases, most of the nurses evaluated ethical issues correctly and recommended correct approaches. No statistically significant difference was found between their educational backgrounds, professional experiences, the ethical issues that they evaluated, and the approaches recommended for problem solving.

However, there are instances where Black people receive preferential treatment over White people. Aims: This study aimed to investigate whether a sample of education professionals would favour Black or White applicants to an academic honour society, and the extent to which any biases were related to conscious intentions. Sample Participants were education professionals ( N = 618; 75.5% White) who completed an online study. Methods: Participants completed a hypothetical admissions task where they evaluated more and less qualified applicants for an academic honour society, and applicants were either White or Black. Participants also completed measures of implicit and explicit racial attitudes. Results: Educational professionals at all levels showed a pro‐Black bias in judgement, adopting a lower acceptance criterion for Black compared to White applicants, replicating previous work using online and undergraduate samples. The bias was present among participants reporting they did not want to be biased or believed they were unbiased, suggesting that bias arose without conscious awareness or intention. Bias was also weakly but reliably related to racial attitudes. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the notion that educators automatically hold lower standards for Black versus White applicants.

9,696,9,"A survey of 137 marriage license applicants and 92 law students showed that both groups had largely incorrect perceptions of the legal terms of the marriage contract as embodied in divorce statutes (DSs), but they had relatively accurate, if sometimes optimistic, perceptions of both the likelihood and the effects of divorce in the population at large. Ss expressed thoroughly idealistic expectations about both the longevity of their own marriages and the consequences should they personally be divorced. Increasing Ss' knowledge of DSs through a course on family law did not diminish this unrealistic optimism.

9,697,4,"Background: General aviation crashes in the United States were analyzed to identity differences between male and female pilots in the circumstances of their crashes and the types of pilot errors involved. Methods: All 144 female pilots who were born between 1933 and 1942 and who were involved in general aviation crashes between 1983 and 1997 were matched 1:2 with 287 male pilots by age within 2 yr, medical certificate and pilot certificate, state or region of crash, and year of crash. Results: Mechanical failure, gear up landings, improper IFR approaches, and collisions with wires or poles were more common in crashes of male pilots. Loss Or control on landing/takeoff was more common in crashes of female pilots. Mishandling aircraft kinetics was the most common error of pilots of both genders and was noted more often in female pilots' crashes (81% vs. 48%) (p < 0.001). Males' crashes were more likely to involve flawed decisions (29% vs. 19% of females' crashes) (p = 0.027) or inattention (32% vs. 19%) (p = 0.004). Older pilots made fewer errors: among males age 55-63, 26% of crashes were without obvious pilot error compared with only 7% at age 40-49 (p = 0.003). Conclusion: There are large gender differences in the types of pilot error involved in general aviation crashes.

9,698,4,"Background: Many interventions have been implemented in recent decades to reduce pilot error in flight operations. This study aims to identify longitudinal trends in the prevalence and patterns of pilot error and other factors in U.S. air carrier mishaps. Method. National Transportation Safety Board investigation reports were examined for 558 air carrier mishaps during 1983-2002. Pilot errors and circumstances of mishaps were described and categorized. Rates were calculated per 10 million flights. Results: The overall mishap rate remained fairly stable, but the proportion of mishaps involving pilot error decreased from 42% in 1983-87 to 25% in 1998-2002, a 40% reduction. The rate of mishaps related to poor decisions declined from 6.2 to 1.8 per 10 million flights, a 71% reduction; much of this decrease was due to a 76% reduction in poor decisions related to weather. Mishandling wind or runway conditions declined by 78%. The rate of mishaps involving poor crew interaction declined by 68%. Mishaps during takeoff declined by 70%, from 5.3 to 1.6 per 10 million flights. The latter reduction was offset by an increase in mishaps while the aircraft was standing, from 2.5 to 6.0 per 10 million flights, and during pushback, which increased from 0 to 3.1 per 10 million flights. Conclusions: Reductions in pilot errors involving decision making and crew coordination are important trends that may reflect improvements in training and technological advances that facilitate good decisions.

Method: Two studies were conducted, the first involving 218 undergraduates who read a newspaper article extract describing an intimate partner violence case, followed by the manipulation of morality-based in-group norms: importance of providing help, support, and report (experimental group) versus doing nothing (control condition). Participants were asked about their willingness to help the victim. Study 2 was conducted with 216 police officers to test the effect of moral in-group norms on their willingness to arrest the alleged perpetrator and assist the victim. Results: Findings from both studies showed that respondents increased their willingness to help the victim and provide support when they strongly identified with the in-group. Conclusion: The decision to intervene to help the victim is based on high identification with own-group social norms, but only for those police and lay people who do identify with the reference group.

9,701,4,"Background: Up to 20% of all trauma patients admitted to an intensive care unit die from their injuries. End-of-life decision making is a variable process that involves prognosis, predicted functional outcomes, personal beliefs, institutional resources, societal norms, and clinician experience. The goal of this study was to better understand end-of-life processes after major injury by comparing clinician viewpoints from various countries and cultures.Methods: A clinician-based, 38-question international survey was used to characterize the impacts of medical, religious, social, and system factors on end-of-life care after trauma.Results: A total of 419 clinicians from the United States (49%), Canada (19%), South Africa (11%), Europe (9%), Asia (8%), and Australasia (4%) completed the survey. In America, the admitting surgeon guided most end-of-life decisions (51%), when compared with all other countries (0-27%). The practice structure of American respondents also varied from other regions. Formal medical futility laws are rarely available (14-38%). Ethical consultation services are often accessible (29-98%), but rarely used (0-29%), and typically unhelpful (<30%). End-of-life decision making for patients with traumatic brain injuries varied extensively across regions with regard to the impact of patient age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and clinician philosophy. Similar differences were observed for spinal cord injuries (age and functional level). The avail-ability and use of ""donation after cardiac death"" also varied substantially between countries.Conclusions: In this unique study, geographic differences in religion, practice composition, decision-maker viewpoint, and institutional resources resulted in significant variation in end-of-life care after injury.

9,702,4,"The decision to recall a product can significantly affect an operations manager's career, the credibility and financial performance of the firm, and the safety of customers. Despite the importance of this decision, there has been little behavioral research on what influences judgment in this task. Leveraging insights from interviews with regulators and professionals in the medical device industry, and supported by behavioral theory, we identify a set of factors that may influence the recall decision. We test the effect of these factors using a primary experiment with 167 managers from a Fortune 500 medical device firm and a replication study with 614 subjects from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We find that a physician's ability to detect a defect prior to product use decreases the likelihood to recall, while a manager's understanding of the root cause of the defect increases the likelihood to recall. In a second study with 372 Amazon Mechanical Turk subjects, we find that perceived patient customer harm and perceived cost of the recall both mediate the relationship between defect detectability and recall likelihood, but that harm is more influential than cost. Further, the perceived cost of the recall also mediates the relationship between root cause understanding and recall likelihood. By uncovering behavioral factors and their mechanisms in the recall decision, this study offers important insights to both industry and regulators.",Ball,2018,The decision to recall: A behavioral investigation in the medical device industry,JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT,62,1,15,Web of Science,"Ball, George P.; Shah, Rachna; Donohue, Karen"
9,703,4,"Background: A growing body of public management literature sheds light on potential shortcomings to quality improvement (QI) and performance management efforts. These challenges stern from heuristics individuals use when interpreting data. Evidence from studies of citizens suggests that individuals' evaluation of data is influenced by the linguistic framing or context of that information and may bias the way they use such information for decision-making. This study extends prospect theory into the field of public health QI by utilizing an experimental design to test for equivalency framing effects on how public health professionals interpret common QI indicators.Methods: An experimental design utilizing randomly assigned survey vignettes is used to test for the influence of framing effects in the interpretation of QI data. The web-based survey assigned a national sample of 286 city and county health officers to a ""positive frame"" group or a ""negative frame"" group and measured perceptions of organizational performance. The majority of respondents self-report as organizational leadership.Results: Public health managers are indeed susceptible to these framing effects and to a similar degree as citizens. Specifically, they tend to interpret QI information presented in a ""positive frame"" as indicating a higher level of performance as the same underlying data presenting in a ""negative frame."" These results are statistically significant and pass robustness checks when regressed against control variables and alternative sources of information.Conclusion: This study helps identify potential areas of reform within the reporting aspects of QI systems. Specifically, there is a need to fully contextualize data when presenting even to subject matter experts to reduce the existence of bias when making decisions and introduce training in data presentation and basic numeracy prior to fully engaging in QI initiatives.",Ballard,2019,Framing Bias in the Interpretation of Quality Improvement Data: Evidence From an Experiment,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT,8,307,314,Web of Science,"Ballard, Andrew"
9,704,4,"AIM: To assess and teach cultural competency skills at the fellowship training level through the use of objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs).METHODS: We revised four scenarios to infuse a specific focus on cross-cultural care, and to render them appropriate for gastroenterology fellows.

A fourth case emphasizing shared decision-making will be described elsewhere. Four stations were completed by fellows and observed live by four faculty members, and the fellows' performance was assessed.RESULTS: Eleven fellows from four programs participated in the four OSCE. In the ""Poor Health Literacy"" case, 18% (2/11) of participants recognized that the standardized patient (SP) had below-basic health literacy. None successfully evaluated the SP's reading skills in a culturally-sensitive manner.

9,706,4,"In soccer penalty kicks, goalkeepers choose their action before they can clearly observe the kick direction. An analysis of 286 penalty kicks in top leagues and championships worldwide shows that given the probability distribution of kick direction, the optimal strategy for goalkeepers is to stay in the goal's center. Goalkeepers, however, almost always jump right or left. We propose the following explanation for this behavior: because the norm is to jump, norm theory [Kahneman, D., &amp; Miller, D. T. (1986). Norm theory: Comparing reality to its alternatives. Psychological Review , 93, 136-153] implies that a goal scored yields worse feelings for the goalkeeper following inaction (staying in the center) than following action (jumping), leading to a bias for action. The omission bias, a bias in favor of inaction, is reversed here because the norm here is reversed--to act rather than to choose inaction. The claim that jumping is the norm is supported by a second study, a survey conducted with 32 top professional goalkeepers. The seemingly biased decision making is particularly striking since the goalkeepers have huge incentives to make correct decisions, and it is a decision they encounter frequently. Finally, we discuss several implications of the action/omission bias for economics and management.

9,708,4,"Background: Highly efficacious evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) exist for children and youth exposed to trauma, yet very few who need the treatments in the community receive them. Research within real-world settings is needed to better understand what is required to translate treatments into the community. Purpose: We aimed to examine the implementation and clinical outcomes of a multiyear project installing 2 EBPs for trauma-exposed youth in community agencies across the state of New Hampshire. Method: We invited clinicians to 2 days of training plus weekly group consultation calls for 9 or 12 months in Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Child Parent Psychotherapy. Implementation metrics included clinician adherence to training, consultation, and treatment delivery expectations. Clinical outcomes included treatment dropout, as well as posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. Results: Of the 292 clinicians meeting eligibility and agreeing to participate, 243 (83%) attended trainings, 168 (58%) began consultation calls, and 70 (24%) adhered to implementation expectations by attending 80% of consultation calls and beginning the treatment with 2 youths.

,709,2,"Objective: Evidence suggests that patient characteristics such as sex, race, and age influence the pain management decisions of health care providers. Although this signifies that patient demographics may be important determinants of health care decisions, pain‐related care also may be impacted by the personal characteristics of the health care practitioner. However, the extent to which health care provider characteristics affect pain management decisions is unclear, underscoring the need for further research in this area. Methods: A total of 154 health care providers (77 physicians, 77 dentists) viewed video vignettes of virtual human (VH) patients varying in sex, race, and age. Practitioners provided computerized ratings of VH patients' pain intensity and unpleasantness, and also reported their willingness to prescribe non‐opioid and opioid analgesics for each patient. Practitioner sex, race, age, and duration of professional experience were included as predictors to determine their impact on pain management decisions. Results: When assessing and treating pain, practitioner sex, race, age, and duration of experience were all significantly associated with pain management decisions. Further, the role of these characteristics differed across VH patient sex, race, and age. Conclusions: These findings suggest that pain assessment and treatment decisions may be impacted by the health care providers' demographic characteristics, effects which may contribute to pain management disparities. Future research is warranted to determine whether findings replicate in other health care disciplines and medical conditions, and identify other practitioner characteristics (e.g., culture) that may affect pain management decisions.

It was hypothesized that participants would exhibit greater activation of noncompliance and health risk stereotypes after subliminal exposure to Hispanic faces compared with non-Hispanic White faces and, because ethnicity was primed outside of conscious awareness, that explicit motivations to control prejudice would not moderate stereotype activation.Methods: Nursing and medical students completed a sequential priming task that measured the speed with which they recognized words related to noncompliance and health risk after subliminal exposure to Hispanic and non-Hispanic White faces. They then completed explicit measures of their motivation to control prejudice against Hispanics.Results: Both nursing and medical students exhibited greater activation of noncompliance and health risk words after subliminal exposure to Hispanic faces, compared with non-Hispanic White faces.

9,715,4,"Background/Purpose: The benefits of prescribing cardiac rehabilitation (CR) for patients following heart surgery is well documented; however, physicians continue to underuse CR programs, and disparities in the referral of women are common. Previous research into the causes of these problems has relied on self-report methods, which presume that physicians have insight into their referral behavior and can describe it accurately. In contrast, the research presented here used clinical judgment analysis (CJA) to discover the tacit judgment and referral policies of individual physicians. The specific aims were to determine 1) what these policies were, 2) the degree of self-insight that individual physicians had into their own policies, 3) the amount of agreement among physicians, and 4) the extent to which judgments were related to attitudes toward CR. Methods: Thirty-six Canadian physicians made judgments and decisions regarding 32 hypothetical cardiac patients, each described on 5 characteristics (gender, age, type of cardiovascular procedure, presence/absence of musculoskeletal pain, and degree of motivation) and then completed the 19 items of the Attitude towards Cardiac Rehabilitation Referral scale. Results: Consistent with previous studies, there was wide variation among physicians in their tacit and stated judgment policies, and self-insight was modest. On the whole, physicians showed evidence of systematic gender bias as they judged women as less likely than men to benefit from CR. Insight data suggest that 1 in 3 physicians were unaware of their own bias. There was greater agreement among physicians in how they described their judgments (stated policies) than in how they actually made them (tacit policies). Correlations between attitude statements and CJA measures were modest. Conclusions: These findings offer some explanation for the slow progress of efforts to improve CR referrals and for gender disparities in referral rates.

9,716,4,"Teacher judgments about students' academic abilities are important for several reasons, including their day-to-day instructional decision making. Not surprisingly, previous studies have investigated the accuracy of teachers' judgments about their students' reading abilities.

This exploratory study offers the first investigation of teachers' judgment accuracy of pre-kindergarten students' early literacy skills, and compares the judgment accuracy of teachers with and without opportunities to administer the Early Literacy Skills Assessment (ELSA).

9,719,4,"A laboratory study of performance appraisal delay and distortion (a) investigated the effects of rater gender, performance level, and feedback requirement, and (b) defined feedback delay as the separate components of appraisal delay and feedback session scheduling delay. Subjects were 64 university business students who had at least 6 months of supervisory experience. Female raters delayed longer when conducting performance appraisals and when scheduling feedback sessions with subordinates, and more positively distorted ratings than did male raters. Moderately low performers were evaluated and scheduled for feedback sessions later, and were evaluated with more positive distortion than were moderately high performers. When required to provide feedback, raters delayed longer appraising performance and distorted ratings more positively. Significant interactions suggest that when feedback is required, female raters may delay appraisals, delay scheduling feedback sessions, and more positively distort their ratings of performance, particularly when rating low performers.

The control group consisted of 59 youth athletes with no soccer experience in the last five years. Players completed a video-based decision-making assessment on an iPad, with response accuracy and response time recorded for various attacking situations (2 vs. 1, 3 vs. 1, 3 vs. 2, 4 vs. 3, and 5 vs. 3).Results: The video-based decision-making assessment showed some construct validity. Response times were significantly faster in early and mid-adolescent players when compared to those in the late childhood group. Furthermore, an overall decline in decision-making performance (i.e. decrease in response accuracy and increase in response time) was observed from the 2 vs. 1 to the 4 vs. 3 situations. The video-based decision-making assessment lacked discriminant validity as minimal differences between academies were evident for response accuracy and response time. Only response accuracy was able to discriminate youth academy soccer players from the control group to some extent.Conclusions: Coaches and sporting professionals should apply caution when interpreting data from practical, video-based decision-making assessments.

The analysis is based on 772 workers’ responses to a vignette describing preparations for care order proceedings. We examine children's involvement along three dimensions including information given to the child, information gathered from the child, and opportunities for their perspectives and interests to be considered. Results show that child protection workers weigh children's involvement differently based upon age. Staff in the four countries were more likely to talk with an older child, to provide information, to gather information, and to include in relevant decision making if the child were 11 compared to five in our vignette. Although the Nordic countries and England provide policy guidance regarding children's role in child protection decision making, we did not see consistently higher indicators of children's involvement from the respondents in these countries. Using child protection system frames to analyze the findings did not produce consistent differences between the family service systems and child protection systems included in this study.

We assessed the feasibility of educating military trainees on accurately obtaining optic nerve sheath diameter measurements using a brief didactic and hands-on training session. Optic nerve sheath diameter is a noninvasive surrogate marker for elevated intracranial pressure, and may be of value in remote military operations, where rapid triage decisions must be made without access to advanced medical equipment.MethodsMilitary trainees with minimal ultrasound experience were given a 5-min didactic presentation on optic nerve sheath diameter ultrasound. Trainees practiced optic nerve sheath diameter measurements guided by emergency physician ultrasound experts. Trainees then measured the optic nerve sheath diameter on normal volunteers. Following this, a trained physician measured the optic nerve sheath diameter on the same volunteer as a criterion standard. An average of three measurements was taken.ResultsTwenty-three military trainees were enrolled. A mixed design ANOVA was used to compare measurements by trainees to those of physicians, with a mean difference of -0.6mm (P=0.76). A Bland-Altman analysis showed that the degree of bias in optic nerve sheath diameter measures provided by trainees was very small: d=-0.004 for the right eye and d=-0.007 for the left eye.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that optic nerve sheath diameter measurement can be accurately performed by novice ultrasonographers after a brief training session.

Analysis showed that community-college-based Ss earned higher ratings for both interpersonal and technical ability, and differences as a function of personality patterns emerged that cut across departments. The 5 female Ss had lower supervisory ratings of interpersonal ability. Positive attributes were influenced by Ss' departmental assignment, with inner-city Ss seeking more schooling and receiving more commendations than Ss in the other groups. Ss' in-service behavior was associated with patterns and elevation of their MMPI profiles and interpersonal needs.

However, the use of CTA within orthopedics is in its infancy. We evaluated the effectiveness of a novel CTA tool to improve understanding of the procedural steps in antegrade femoral intramedullary nailing. Material and methods - Design: A modified Delphi technique was used to generate a CTA from 3 expert orthopedic trauma surgeons for antegrade femoral intramedullary nailing. The written and audiovisual information was combined to describe the technical steps, decision points, and errors for each phase of this procedure Validation: A randomized double-blind controlled trial was undertaken with 22 medical students (novices) randomized into 2 equal groups. The intervention group were given the CTA tool and the control group were given a standard operative technique manual. They were assessed using the validated ""Touch Surgery (TM)"" application assessment tool on femoral intramedullary nailing. Results - The pre-test scores between the two groups were similar.

,731,2,"Practicing sport at top level requires excellent physical and cognitive skills. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether specific sport practice may affect the preparation-perception-action stages of processing during a visuo-motor task requiring perceptual discrimination and fast response. We recruited 39 participants (two groups of professional fencers and boxers, and a control group; N = 13 for each group) and measured behavioral performance and event-related potentials (ERPs) while performing a go/no-go task. Results revealed that athletes were faster than controls, while fencers were more accurate than boxers. ERP analysis revealed that motor preparation, indexed by the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), was increased in athletes than controls, whereas the top-down attentional control, reflected by the prefrontal negativity (pN) component, was enhanced only in fencers when compared to controls. Most of the post-stimulus ERPs i.e. the N1, the N2, the P3, and the pP2, were enhanced in fencers. Combat sports require fast action execution, but the preparatory brain activity might differ according to the specific practice required by each discipline. Boxers might afford to commit more errors (as reflected by high commission error (CE) rate and by a small pN amplitude), while fencers have to be as much fast and accurate as possible (thanks to an enhanced pN amplitude). Although the possible influence of repetitive head blows on cerebral activity cannot be excluded in boxers, our results suggest that cognitive benefits of high-level sport practice might also be transferred to the daily (i.e., no sport-related) activities.

,737,2,"INTRODUCTION: The effectiveness of a tiered emergency medical services system often hinges upon the ability of initial care providers with little or no formal training to identify emergent patient needs and determine the best means to meet those needs.OBJECTIVES: To determine if out-of-hospital emergency care providers consistently make appropriate triage, transportation, and destination decisions; and to determine if experience and training have an effect on these decisions.METHODS: A survey consisting of 14 patient-care scenarios was administered to certified and non-certified out-of-hospital emergency-care providers (n = 311) from 20 randomly selected EMS agencies. These agencies were part of EMS systems that utilize one, two, and three tiered responses by ambulance and fire-based commercial, municipal, and volunteer agencies. Participants were asked to select the most appropriate mode of transport and destination facility using the assumption that they had responded to each scenario in a basic life support ambulance. Answers included transporting the patient to various receiving facilities or requesting a more advanced-level unit to respond to the scene. Transport times to receiving facilities and estimated times of arrival for advanced-level units were provided with each choice. Eight emergency physicians unanimously had agreed upon the most appropriate answer for each scenario. A two-tailed t-test was used to compare the scores of the certified and non-certified groups; and Spearman's Correlation Coefficients were used to test the effects of experience and training.RESULTS: Non-certified providers (n = 108) had a mean score of 32.6% or 4.6 (SD = 1.84) correct answers; certified providers (n = 203) had a mean score of 41.1% or 5.76 (SD = 2.12) correct answers (p < 0.000001).

9,738,4,"Purpose: Extant branding literature is dominated by a metaphorical view of value co-creation in which the roles of brand actors remain unspecified. To help provide clarity, the purpose of this paper is to critically appraise how brand professionals understand brand value co-creation and perceive their role in facilitating it, with the aim of questioning its viability in day-to-day brand management practices. Design/methodology/approach: Building on brand professionals’ reflexivity, the study develops a qualitative methodological glance via semi-structured interviews based on confrontational techniques with a purposive sample of 28 experienced brand decision-makers. Findings: Brand professionals perceive accessibility, reciprocity and citizenship as the gateways provided by the firm for value co-creation to happen. Despite their enthusiastic rhetorical afflatus in making explicit their viewpoints about how firms can facilitate value co-creation, the current translation into practice of the role of the firm does not seem to be able to overcome the sender-biased approach that still resides in brand management. Practical implications: To go beyond the limits of rhetorical representations and make brand value facilitation more actionable, the authors provide guidelines on how firms can create and enhance the circumstances for the co-creation of brand value to occur in interactions with consumers and stakeholders. Originality/value: This study contributes to the critical actionability of the brand value co-creation by elucidating how firms currently perceive their facilitation role.

9,742,4,"Purpose: This study sought to determine whether (a) Hispanic nurses differ in assessment and management of pain for Hispanic versus non-Hispanic patients and (b) relationships exist between measures of acculturation and Hispanic nurses’ assessment and pain management. Method: A descriptive, cross-sectional correlation design study used three survey instruments to identify Hispanic nurses’ cultural beliefs and how they approach pain management in clinical settings. Results: The average nurse had inadequate knowledge. However, a sample strength was accurate pain assessment for both non- Hispanic and Hispanic patients; they had higher pain management decision-making scores for Hispanic patients. Conclusion: Results are consistent with empirical findings that nurses in general have inadequate knowledge of pain management, with important implications regarding needing further research and training in this area. Implications for Practice: Future research should examine whether other ethnic groups are more likely to make correct decisions in pain management for members of their ethnic group.

9,743,9,"Police integrity, or the lack thereof, is a frequent topic throughout media, academia, and all law enforcement organizations. The issue has been addressed on an individual and organizational level but continues to raise as many questions as it answers. One argument is that police training causes declination in recruits' values, which eventually leads to officers acting in unethical ways. The present study examined the extent to which police academy training impacts recruits' self-reported integrity, which was measured at the beginning and end of academy training. Three different training formats (n1=143, n2=87, n3=27) were observed, social desirability was assessed to control for response bias, and self-reported emotional intelligence was measured as a potential moderator variable. Results indicated that participants started with significantly higher than average levels of integrity (with Cohen's d values ranging from .56 to .83) and training had no significant impact on their integrity scores, even when corrected for social desirability. The results were not impacted by the length of training, pre-academy level of emotional intelligence, or a variety of demographic variables.

9,744,4,"This experiment tested whether the conformism observed among panels of judges in aesthetic sports also occurs among judges in judo. Similar to aesthetic sports, judo judging relies upon a form of open feedback. However, in judo, this system is reactive (i.e. two judges have to publicly ‘correct’ the score given by the higher-status referee), whereas it is active in aesthetic sports (i.e. judges with equal status report their score simultaneously and can use the feedback about the scores of their colleagues for evaluating later performances). In order to test whether such reactive open-feedback system leads to conformism among judges in judo, we designed an experiment in which this feedback was manipulated. Participants were 20 certified Flemish judges, who had to score two sets of 11 ambiguous video sequences that are used during formation and training of judo judges: one set with feedback about the referee's score and one set without feedback. The results revealed that when participants knew the referee's score, their scores were significantly more in line with this score than when they did not know this score. More specifically, for both sets of sequences at least 10% less deviations from the referee were observed when participants were given feedback about the score of the referee. These results suggest that preventable conformism can occur in typical judo judging, that is with reactive open feedback.

9,745,9,"Disparities in health care associated with patients' gender, race, and age are well documented. Previous studies using virtual human (VH) technology have demonstrated that provider characteristics may play an important role in pain management decisions. However, these studies have largely emphasized group differences. The aims of this study were to examine dentists' and physicians' use of VH characteristics when making clinical judgments (i.e., cue use) and to identify provider characteristics associated with the magnitude of the impact of these cues (beta-weights). Providers (N=152; 76 physicians, 76 dentists) viewed video vignettes of VH patients varying in gender (male/female), race (white/black), and age (younger/older). Participants rated VH patients' pain intensity and unpleasantness and then rated their own likelihood of administering non-opioid and opioid analgesics. Compared to physicians, dentists had significantly lower beta-weights associated with VH age cues for all ratings (p<0.001; d>0.69). These effects varied by provider race and gender. For pain intensity, professional differences were present only among non-white providers. White providers had greater beta-weights than non-white providers for pain unpleasantness but only among men. Provider differences regarding the use of VH age cues in non-opioid analgesic administration were present among all providers except non-white males. These findings highlight the interaction of patient and provider factors in driving clinical decision making. Although profession was related to use of VH age cues in pain-related clinical judgments, this relationship was modified by providers' personal characteristics.

9,747,4,"Background: Non medical determinants of medical decision making were investigated in an international research project in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The key question in this paper is whether and to what extent doctors’ diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in coronary heart disease (CHD) are influenced by patient gender. Methods: A factorial experiment with a videotaped patient consultation was conducted. Professional actors played the role of patients with symptoms of CHD. Several alternative versions were taped featuring the same script with patient-actors of different gender, age, race, and socioeconomic status. The videotapes were presented to a randomly selected sample of 128 primary care physicians in each country. Using an interview with standardized and open-ended questions, physicians were asked how they would diagnose and treat such a patient after they had seen the video. Results: Results show gender differences in the diagnostic strategies of the doctors. Women were asked different questions, CHD was mentioned more often as a possible diagnosis for men than for women, and physicians were less certain about their diagnosis with female patients. Gender differences in management decisions (therapy and lifestyle advice) are less pronounced and less consistent than in diagnostic decisions. Magnitude of gender effect on doctors’ decisions varies between countries with smaller influences in the United States. Conclusion: Although patients with identical symptoms were presented, primary care doctors’ behavior differed by patients’ gender in all 3 countries under study. These gender differences suggest that women may be less likely to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment than men.

9,748,9,"Objectives: The electronic health record is a primary source of information for all professional groups participating in ICU rounds. We previously demonstrated that, individually, all professional groups involved in rounds have significant blind spots in recognition of patient safety issues in the electronic health record. However, it is unclear how team dynamics impacts identification and verbalization of viewed data. Therefore, we created an ICU rounding simulation to assess how the interprofessional team recognized and reported data and its impact on decision-making.Design: Each member of the ICU team reviewed a simulated ICU chart in the electronic health record which contained embedded patient safety issues. The team conducted simulated rounds according to the ICU's existing rounding script and was assessed for recognition of safety issues.Setting: Academic medical center.Subjects: ICU residents, nurses, and pharmacists.Intervention: None.Measurements and Main Results: Twenty-eight teams recognized 68.6% of safety issues with only 50% teams having the primary diagnosis in their differential. Individually, interns, nurses, and pharmacists recognized 30.4%, 15.6%, and 19.6% of safety items, respectively. However, there was a negative correlation between the intern's performance and the nurse's or the pharmacist's performance within a given team. The wide variance in recognition of data resulted in wide variance in orders. Overall, there were 21.8 orders requested and 21.6 orders placed per case resulting in 3.6 order entry inconsistencies/case. Between the two cases, there were 145 distinct orders place with 43% being unique to a specific team and only 2% placed by all teams.Conclusions: Although significant blind spots exist in the interprofessional team's ability to recognize safety issues in the electronic health record, the inclusion of other professional groups does serve as a partial safety net to improve recognition.

Ss had to determine at each stage of case management the appropriate dose to maintain a therapeutic concentration of phenytoin for a given patient. The game taught the majority of Ss to make safe and effective dose increments but not optimal ones. Ss learned that the correct response to an overdose is to withdraw the drug completely.

They rated reasons both for continuing the initial decision (e.g., stay with the medication already in use) and for switching to a new alternative (e.g., a different; medication). There were two main findings: First, the residents' ratings of whether to continue or switch medical treatments were not influenced by the amount of the initial investment (p's > 0.05). Second, residents' reasoning was more normative in medical than in non-medical situations, in which it paralleled that of undergraduates (p's < 0.05).Conclusions: Medical residents' evaluation of treatment decisions reflected good reasoning, in that they were not influenced by the amount of time and/or money that had already been invested in treating a patient. However, the residents did demonstrate a sunk-cost effect in evaluating non-medical situations. Thus, any advantage in decision making that is conferred by medical training appears to be domain specific. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

9,751,4,"BACKGROUND: Overconfidence is the tendency to overestimate the knowledge, capacity, or performance one really possesses. This cognitive bias could be potentially dangerous in medical decision-making, considering the impact it could have on patient health care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of overconfidence and underconfidence in medical student knowledge on general surgery by using traditional and new statistical approaches.METHODS: During the application of a multiple-choice examination, 251 next-to-graduate medical students were invited to express the accuracy of their responses by choosing their own perceived confidence level for a set of questions. Analysis was done by comparing the difference between percentage of right answers (student's actual knowledge or accuracy) and self-estimated confidence level (student's perceived knowledge or confidence). Overconfidence was defined as a positive difference between confidence and accuracy, and underconfidence as a negative difference.RESULTS: Nearly 12% of students showed significant overconfidence regarding their actual knowledge or accuracy levels. Better students showed a lower overconfidence effect than students with poorer performance. On the other hand, underconfidence was less likely than overconfidence (8.3% of students), and that effect was most frequently found in students who performed better in examinations.CONCLUSIONS: The small proportion of our students exhibiting overconfidence or underconfidence behaviors moderates the need for educational interventions. Nevertheless, promoting prudence in individualized students manifesting overconfidence, and trust in those reporting significant underconfidence could increase the reliability of medical judgment during their future professional life. Overconfidence in individuals with lower scores in examinations may depend on a ceiling-like effect, since worst ranked students have a wider upper margin to manifest their confidence perceptions. The most confident students showed higher scores in examinations than the less confident ones. From this point of view, confidence could be considered an essential ingredient of success in examination performance. (C) 2018 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

,752,2,"Aims: (1) To model the process of use and usability of pH strips (2) to identify, through simulation studies, the likelihood of misreading pH strips, and to assess professional's acceptance, trust and perceived usability of pH strips. Methods: This study was undertaken in four phases and used a mixed method approach (an audit, a semi-structured interview, a survey and simulation study). The three months audit was of 24 patients, the semi-structured interview was performed with 19 health professionals and informed the process of use of pH strips. A survey of 134 professionals and novices explored the likelihood of misinterpreting pH strips. Standardised questionnaires were used to assess professionals perceived usability, trust and acceptance of pH strip use in a simulated study. Results: The audit found that in 45.7% of the cases aspiration could not be achieved, and that 54% of the NG-tube insertions required x-ray confirmation. None of those interviewed had received formal training on pH strips use. In the simulated study, participants made up to 11.15% errors in reading the strips with important implications for decision making regarding NG tube placement. No difference was identified between professionals and novices in their likelihood of misinterpreting the pH value of the strips. Whilst the overall experience of usage is poor (47.3%), health professionals gave a positive level of trust in both the interview (62.6%) and the survey (68.7%) and acceptance (interview group 65.1%, survey group 74.7%). They also reported anxiety in the use of strips (interview group 29.7%, survey group 49.7%). Conclusions: Significant errors occur when using pH strips in a simulated study.

9,753,4,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine the reasoning used by clinicians when deciding whether errors observed during the performance of everyday activities were made by clients with acquired brain injury (ABI) or by healthy controls. Methods: Ninety clinicians observed 27 short video clips of subjects (ABI, healthy controls), carrying out the Baycrest Multiple Errands Test. On the basis of their observations, they classified subjects into either an ABI or healthy control group and specified their reasons. Their reasoning was analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The majority of the coded material explaining the reasoning behind correct attributions of performance errors to people with ABI related to 3 general themes: (1) inefficient executive functioning, (2) task-related difficulty, and (3) prediction of impact on independence in everyday activities. Clinicians were most successful at identifying neurological subjects when subjects either omitted tasks or took an excessive amount of time to complete the test. Conclusions: Correctly interpreting performance errors in real-world tests relies on clinicians’ observational and clinical reasoning skills combined with their theoretical knowledge of constructs underlying the evaluation. Some clinical signs bear more weight than others when clinicians interpret performance errors to determine whether the behavior is pathological.

Methods: Telephone interviews with 3205 internists and family or general physicians were completed between 1996 and 1997 for the Community Tracking Study. Physicians responded to six vignettes describing model patients with presentations designed to have multiple appropriate treatment plans: a 50-year-old man with a 1-month history of exertional chest pain who may need a referral to a cardiologist, a 60-year-old man with a normal digital rectal examination (DRE) who may benefit from a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, a 40-year-old married woman with vaginal itching and discharge who may benefit from an office visit, a 60-year-old man with symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) who may benefit from a urological consultation, a 35-year-old man with back pain and a new left footdrop who may benefit from an MRI, and a 50-year-old man with elevated cholesterol and no other cardiac risk factors who may benefit from cholesterol-lowering agents. Results: Female physicians are significantly more likely than males to refer a patient with BPH to a urologist (37.5% vs. 24.9%, p &lt; 0.001). Male physicians are significantly more likely to recommend that a woman with vaginal itching and discharge have an office visit (52.7% vs. 40.6%, p &lt; 0.001). Male physicians recommend cholesterol-lowering agents slightly more often than women physicians (39.4% vs. 36.4%, p &lt; 0.03) and recommend a PSA test more often than female physicians (73.1% vs. 64.4%, p &lt; 0.001). Neither physician attributes, practice characteristics, referral patterns, nor geographical traits account for the disparity between male and female physicians in the treatment of BPH. Approximately 40% of the gender gap in treatment of vaginal itching and discharge can be attributed to physician attributes. The association between provider gender and the decision to prescribe cholesterol-lowering agents and the association between provider gender and recommending a PSA test are explained by physician attributes. Conclusions: Gender differences in treatment seem to appear most strongly for genital-specific conditions. The results may suggest that physicians use fewer resources to treat the genital- specific conditions of patients who share their sex.

9,758,9,"This article examines the boundaries of motivated reasoning in legal decision making. We propose a model of attitudinal influence involving analogical perception. Attitudes influence judgments by affecting the perceived similarity between a target case and cases cited as precedent. Bias should be most apparent in judging similarity when cases are moderately similar on objective dimensions. We conducted two experiments: the first with undergraduates, the second with undergraduates and law students. Participants in each experiment read a mock newspaper article that described a ""target case"" involving unlawful discrimination. Embedded in the article was a description of a ""source case"" cited as legal precedent. Participants in both studies were more likely to find source cases with outcomes that supported their policy views in the target dispute as analogous to that litigation.

Compared to non-pilots, pilots detected more malfunctioning instruments, had shorter dwell times on the instruments, made more transitions, visited task-relevant areas more often, and dwelled longer on the areas between the instruments. These results provide evidence for three theories that explain underlying processes for expert performance: The long-term working memory theory, the information-reduction hypothesis, and the holistic model of image perception. In addition, the results for generic attentional skills indicated a higher capability to switch between global and local information processing in pilots compared to non-pilots.

9,760,1,"Purpose: To reduce errors in surgery using a resident training program based on a taxonomy that highlights three kinds of errors: judgment, inattention to detail, and problem understanding. Method: The training program module at the University of South Florida incorporated a three-item situational judgment test, video training (which included a lecture and behavior modeling), and role-plays (in which residents participated and received feedback from faculty). Two kinds of outcome data were collected from 33 residents during 2006-2007: (1) behaviors during the training and (2) on-the-job surgical complication records 12 months before and 6 months after training. For the data collected during training, participants were assigned to a condition (19 video condition, 13 control condition); for the data collected on the job, an interrupted time series design was used. Results: Data from 32 residents were analyzed (one resident's data were excluded). One of the situational judgment items improved significantly over time ( d = 0.45); the other two did not ( d = 0.36, 0.25). Surgical complications and errors decreased over the course of the study (the correlation between complications and time in months was r = -0.47, for errors and time, r = -0.55). Effects of video behavior modeling on specific errors measured during role-plays were not significant (effect sizes for binary outcomes were phi = -0.05 and phi = 0.01, and for continuous outcomes, d ranged from -0.02 to 0.34).

9,761,4,"Despite the current push toward the practice of evidence-based medicine and comparative effectiveness research, clinicians’ decisions may be influenced not only by evidence, but also by cognitive biases. A cognitive bias describes a tendency to make systematic errors in certain circumstances based on cognitive factors rather than evidence. Though health care providers have been shown in several studies to be susceptible to a variety of types of cognitive biases, research on the role of the sunk-cost bias in clinical decision-making is extremely limited. The sunk-cost bias is the tendency to pursue a course of action, even after it has proved to be suboptimal, because resources have been invested in that course of action. This study explores whether health care providers’ medical treatment recommendations are affected by prior investments in a course of treatment. Specifically, we surveyed 389 health care providers in a large urban medical center in the United States during August 2009. We asked participants to make a treatment recommendation based on one of four hypothetical clinical scenarios that varied in the source and type of prior investment described. By comparing recommendations across scenarios, we found that providers did not demonstrate a sunk-cost effect; rather, they demonstrated a significant tendency to over-compensate for the effect. In addition, we found that more than one in ten health care providers recommended continuation of an ineffective treatment.

,763,2,"OBJECTIVES: To identify whether inter- and intra-operator variability occurs in the measurement of canine packed cell volume and, if so, at which stage these errors occur.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Undergraduate veterinary students and veterinary surgeons were recruited to measure the packed cell volumes of three samples in duplicate. Measurements from each sample were confirmed by one author, and it was then ascertained whether the error was made in the capillary preparation or reading.RESULTS: Data were obtained from 44 students and 11 vets. A total of 25% of students made errors associated with inadequate mixing; 23% students and 9% of vets made errors consistent with incorrect reading. There was also less intra-operator variation in values within the vet group (0.027 from the mean) in comparison to the student group (-0.21 from the mean). A total of 68.2% of students and 91% of vets filled the capillary tubes outwith World Health Organisation standards of two-thirds to three-quarters full.CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Packed cell volume measurement is extremely useful when measuring erythroid mass, but it is crucial that the results upon which decisions are made are accurate and precise in order to manage these cases appropriately.

9,764,4,"Court-appointed child advocates, attorneys, guardians ad litem, and therapists were asked to rate preferred traits for mothers and fathers, and to make custody decisions and abuse likelihood ratings for children in one of two vignettes that varied only as to whether mother or father was described as incompetent to parent without threat of further abuse. Results revealed that this sample of professionals did not hold double standards with respect to attributes important for mothers versus fathers. To the contrary, interpersonal sensitivity traits, traditionally identified as most prevalent among women, were valued equally in mothers and fathers and preferred for both parents to interpersonal potency, traditionally ascribed more readily to men. Further, decisions about custody and placement or abuse likelihood were not affected by any sex-role stereotypes professionals herd about parents, nor by professionals' gender or specific occupation. The only factor that affected custody judgments and abuse likelihood ratings was the competence of the parent in question. These findings suggest that biases with regard to gender or traditional sex-role preferences for parents are disappearing among professionals who make important placement decisions in the lives of abused children. Future studies must assess whether these theoretical findings translate into actual behavior in real-life abuse cases for the professional groups represented in this sample.",BREMS,1995,ASSESSMENT OF FAIRNESS IN CHILD-CUSTODY DECISIONS,CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT,19,345,353,Web of Science,"BREMS, C; CARSSOW, KL; SHOOK, C; STURGILL, S; CANNAVA, P"

Club cricket batters were randomized into (a) a visual-perceptual group that received temporal occlusion training (n = 13), (b) a visuomotor group that received temporal occlusion training coupled with motor pattern practice of the observed bowler’s action (n = 13), and (c) a no-training control group (n = 13). They completed a fast bowler video-based temporal occlusion prepost anticipation test, as well as a transfer temporal occlusion test that included different fast and slow bowlers. Results indicated visual-perceptual and visuomotor groups equally improved pick up of advance cues across prepost tests. Additive motor pattern practice for the visuomotor group facilitated superior anticipation through earlier pick up of advance information across the transfer tests. No improvement was found for the control group. The findings indicate that visual and combined motor experience facilitates learning, but additive motor experience facilitates superior transfer.

As evidenced by incidents in the Persian Gulf conflict with Iraq, the potential for fratricide from inaccurate recognition is immense, even under favorable environmental conditions. Specific training on critical vehicle cues can aid in enhancing correct recognitions, and turrets are a major tank recognition cue. To assess the effectiveness of turret recognition, 10 male active duty U.S. Army captains made timed friend-foe determinations of 144 tachistoscopically presented drawings of U.S., German, Soviet, and British tanks. Each tank was represented as either whole vehicle or turret, presented for either 100 or 500 ms, and from either a flank or frontal viewpoint. Viewing the turrets was generally as effective as viewing entire vehicles, but frontal turret views produced much slower and less accurate recognition than did flank position turret views. Additional training is recommended for rapidly observing these vehicles from frontal viewpoints.

9,768,4,"Background: Pediatric palliative care (PPC) education is lacking in pediatric critical care medicine (PCCM) fellowships, despite the desire of many program directors and fellows to expand difficult conversation training. Simulation-based training is an experiential method for practicing challenging communication skills such as breaking bad news, disclosing medical errors, navigating goals of care, and supporting medical decision-making. Methods: We describe a simulation-based PPC communication series for PCCM fellows, including presimulation session, simulation session, debriefing, and evaluation methods. From 2011 to 2017, 28 PCCM fellows participated in a biannual half-day simulation session. Each session included 3 scenarios (allowing for participation in up to 18 scenarios over 3 years). Standardized patients portrayed the child's mother. PCCM and interprofessional PPC faculty cofacilitated, evaluated, and debriefed the fellows after each scenario. Fellows were evaluated in 4 communication categories (general skills, breaking bad news, goals of care, and resuscitation) using a 3-point scale. A retrospective descriptive analysis was conducted. Results: One hundred sixteen evaluations were completed for 18 PCCM fellows. Median scores for general communication items, breaking bad news, and goals of care ranged from 2.0 to 3.0 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0-1) with scores for resuscitation lower at 1.0 (IQR: 1.5-2). Discussion: This experiential simulation-based PPC communication curriculum taught PCCM fellows valuable palliative communication techniques although revealed growth opportunities within more complex communication tasks. The preparation, methods, and lessons learned for an effective palliative simulation curriculum can be expanded upon by other pediatric training programs, and a more rigorous research program should be added to educational series.",Brock,2019,Simulation-Based Palliative Care Communication for Pediatric Critical Care Fellows,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE MEDICINE,36,820,830,Web of Science,"Brock, Katharine E.; Tracewski, Meghan; Allen, Kristen E.; Klick, Jeffrey; Petrillo, Toni; Hebbar, Kiran B."

However, no randomized controlled trials have been able to demonstrate the effects of simulation teaching in real-life patient care. This study aimed to determine whether simulation-based training or an interactive seminar resulted in better patient care during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-a high stakes clinical setting.Methods: This study was conducted as a prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. After institutional research board approval, 20 anesthesiology trainees, postgraduate year 4 or higher, inexperienced in CPB weaning, and 60 patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting were recruited. Each trainee received a teaching syllabus for CPB weaning 1 week before attempting to wean a patient from CPB (pretest). One week later, each trainee received a 2-h training session with either high-fidelity simulation-based training or a 2-h interactive seminar. Each trainee then weaned patients from CPB within 2 weeks (posttest) and 5 weeks (retention test) from the intervention. Clinical performance was measured using the validated Anesthesiologists' Nontechnical Skills Global Rating Scale and a checklist of expected clinical actions.Results: Pretest Global Rating Scale and checklist performances were similar. The simulation group scored significantly higher than the seminar group at both posttest (Global Rating Scale [mean +/- standard error]: 14.3 +/- 0.41 vs. 11.8 +/- 0.41, P < 0.001; checklist: 89.9 +/- 3.0% vs. 75.4 +/- 3.0%, P = 0.003) and retention test (Global Rating Scale: 14.1 +/- 0.41 vs. 11.7 +/- 0.41, P < 0.001; checklist: 93.2 +/- 2.4% vs. 77.0 +/- 2.4%, P < 0.001).Conclusion: Skills required to wean a patient from CPB can be acquired through simulation-based training.

9,772,4,"The purpose of this study is to expand our understanding of the factors that influence ethical behavioral intentions of public accountants. Recent scandals have dominated the news and have caused legislators, regulators and the public to question the role of the accounting profession. Legislative changes have brought about major structural changes in the profession and continued scrutiny will surely lead to further changes. Thus, developing an understanding of the personal and contextual factors that influence ethical decisions is critical. An extension of the theory of planned behavior [Ajzen, L: 1985, Action Control-From Cognition to Behavior (Springer, Heidelberg)], the model used in this study examined the influence of personal, social and organizational factors on ethical intentions. Specifically, the individual level model tested direct eects of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, moral sensitivity and ethical climate. Professionals from five accounting firms completed a survey that measured responses to ethical dilemmas related to the public accounting domain. To minimize the potential impact of common method bias, the survey instrument was administered in two phases. Hypotheses were evaluated using a structural modeling technique, partial least squares. Results show strong support for a direct relationship between attitudes and ethical intentions. The proposed direct eect of subjective norms was not supported. However, a significant relationship between subjective norms and attitudes was found. Professionals' attitudes towards ethical issues clearly influence intentions. Moreover, this study illustrates the potential influence of social factors in attitude formation. Future research should explore the factors in the public accounting domain that most strongly influence attitude formation.

9,773,4,"Objective: To test the hypothesis that racial biases in opioid prescribing would be more likely under high levels of cognitive load, defined as the amount of mental activity imposed on working memory, which may come from environmental factors such as stressful conditions, chaotic workplace, staffing insufficiency, and competing demands, one's own psychological or physiological state, as well as from demands inherent in the task at hand. Design: Two (patient race: White vs Black) by two (cognitive load: low vs high) between‐subjects factorial design. Setting and Participants Ninety‐eight primary care physicians from the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. Methods: Web‐based experimental study. Physicians were randomly assigned to read vignettes about either a Black or White patient, under low vs high cognitive load, and to indicate their likelihood of prescribing opioids. High cognitive load was induced by having physicians perform a concurrent task under time pressure. Results: There was a three‐way interaction between patient race, cognitive load, and physician gender on prescribing decisions (P = 0.034). Hypotheses were partially confirmed. Male physicians were less likely to prescribe opioids for Black than White patients under high cognitive load (12.5% vs 30.0%) and were more likely to prescribe opioids for Black than White patients under low cognitive load (30.8% vs 10.5%). By contrast, female physicians were more likely to prescribe opioids for Black than White patients in both conditions, with greater racial differences under high (39.1% vs 15.8%) vs low cognitive load (28.6% vs 21.7%). Conclusions: Physician gender affected the way in which patient race and cognitive load influenced decisions to prescribe opioids for chronic pain.

9,776,4,"Purpose: Interviewing victims of child sex abuse requires considerable care in order to minimise error. Due to children’s heightened suggestibility any question asked of a child could potentially incite error that could undermine the witness’s credibility. A focus group was conducted in order to facilitate the development of guidance for interviewers around the circumstances in which it is necessary to ask children follow-up questions in an interview. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Seven Crown prosecutors representing every Australian state and territory (with the exception of one small state) were issued with 25 hypothetical narrative accounts of child abuse and asked to indicate what information, if any, required follow-up in the child’s narrative. Their responses and rationale for requiring following up in some cases and not others were discussed. Findings: Thematic analysis revealed three recommendations to guide questioning: whether the case involved identification or recognition evidence; the presence of contextual features that may influence the witness’s memory, or that should trigger a particular line of questioning; and whether the information can or should be sought at a later stage by the trial prosecutor, rather than by the interviewer. Practical implications: The recommendations are discussed within the context of their implications for interviewing, that is, how each recommendation could be implemented in practice. Originality/value: The present study extends prior literature by elucidating principles to guide decision making across interview topic areas. The need for such guidance is highlighted by research suggesting that topics such as offender identity, offence time and place, and witnesses are a source of overzealous questioning in interviews.

In this survey study of 115 US medical students, we examined associations between biases (racism and heterosexism) and PrEP clinical decision-making and explored prior PrEP education as a potential buffer. After viewing a vignette about a PrEP-seeking MSM patient, participants reported anticipated patient behavior (condomless sex, extra-relational sex, and adherence), intention to prescribe PrEP to the patient, biases, and background characteristics. Minimal evidence for racism affecting clinical decision-making emerged. In unadjusted analyses, heterosexism indirectly affected prescribing intention via all anticipated behaviors, tested as parallel mediators. Participants expressing greater heterosexism more strongly anticipated increased risk behavior and adherence problems, which were associated with lower prescribing intention. The indirect effect via condomless sex remained significant adjusting for background characteristics. Prior PrEP education did not buffer any indirect effects.

A focus-group discussion involving a coach and a number of team captains of a collegiate-level softball team identified the typical instructions used for batting (i.e., explicit) and developed an analogy instruction that combined these rules in 1 biomechanical metaphor (i.e., swing your bat like you are breaking a tree in front of you with an axe). A total of 40 collegiate-level club players (20 novices and 20 intermediates) were assigned to either an analogy learning or an explicit learning group and took part in 6 training sessions. Batting performance was assessed using a standardized criteria-based rating scale in single-task pretest and posttest, and a dual-task test after training. The findings show that the novice, but not the intermediate players, displayed significant improvements in batting performance after training. Novices who received the analogy instruction displayed stable batting performance in the dual-task test, but novices who received explicit instructions, and intermediate players who received the analogy instruction, displayed batting performance decrements. The findings suggest that the benefits of analogy instructions are evident only in novices; learners’ previous experiences must, therefore, be carefully considered when developing coaching programs.

Before and after the course, a diagnostic test with a series of clinical images of pigmented skin lesions including four invasive melanomas (mean thickness, 1.5 mm; range, 0.8-2.2) was performed (open intervention study). Although only 46.8% of observations yielded a correct melanoma diagnosis at baseline, 96.1% of melanoma observations were correctly associated with intention to refer the lesion to dermatologist. After training, the percentage of correct melanoma diagnosis significantly increased (76.2%, P = 0.01) while no further improvement was found as to sensitivity of referral (94.8%, P = 0.58). Compared to baseline, post-training evaluation showed a significant reduction of benign lesions sent to dermatologist: the percentage lowered from 52.1 to 35.8% (P = 0.0014) for melanocytic nevi and from 38.6 to 17.5% (P < 0.001) for benign non-melanocytic lesions (pigmented seborrheic keratoses, dermatofibromas, and vascular lesions).

9,783,1,"Introduction: Diagnostic reminder systems (DRS) may help students improve their clinical reasoning skill and gain competency in using informatics tools. This study explored the influence of Isabel PRO, a web-based DRS, on student diagnostic reasoning during simulated encounters.Methods: Diagnostic reasoning was assessed in 20 fourth-year medical students during four simulated case scenarios. After seeing each case, students submitted diagnostic hypotheses before (Pre-Isabel) and after (Post-Isabel) using Isabel Pro. The quality of the Pre- and Post-Isabel diagnostic hypotheses was assessed and compared to determine the impact of a DRS on student diagnostic reasoning. A follow-up survey and focus group identified student perception toward the use of a DRS in educational settings.Results: Paired t testing demonstrated that diagnostic accuracy significantly improved after using Isabel PRO (P < 0.05). Students found the software relatively simple to learn, felt that it helped them reflect on diagnostic options that they had not originally considered, and valued the opportunity to use the software in conjunction with simulated cases.Conclusions: Despite limited experience, students were able to effectively use a DRS to improve their diagnostic accuracy. Use of a DRS within the context of a patient case represents a distinct clinical skill set requiring appropriate training. Providing learners with gold standard examples of how to best use a specific informatics tool within specific clinical situations is an essential learning component.

,784,2,"BACKGROUND: Physicians rely upon chest pain history to make management decisions in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, particularly where the diagnosis is not immediately apparent through electrocardiography and troponin testing. The objective of this study was to establish the discriminatory value of ""typicality of chest pain"" and the effect of clinician experience, for the prediction of acute myocardial infarction and presence of significant coronary artery disease.METHODS: This prospective single-center observational study was undertaken in a UK General Hospital emergency department. We recruited consecutive adults with chest pain and a nondiagnostic electrocardiogram, for whom the treating physician determined that delayed troponin testing was necessary. Using their own clinical judgment, physicians recorded whether the chest pain described was typical or atypical for acute coronary syndrome. Physicians were defined as ""experienced"" or ""novice"" according to postgraduate experience. Acute myocardial infarction was adjudicated using a high-sensitivity troponin (hs-cTn) assay, whereas coronary artery disease was adjudicated angiographically.RESULTS: Overall, 912 patients had typicality of chest pain assessed, of whom 114/912 (12.5%) had an acute myocardial infarction and 157/912 (17.2%) underwent angiography. In patients undergoing angiography, 90/157 (57.3%) had hs-cTn elevation, of whom 60 (66.7%) had significant coronary artery disease. Sixty-seven of 157 (42.7%) patients had angiography without hs-cTn elevation; of these, 31 (46.2%) had significant coronary artery disease. For the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, chest pain typicality had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.54 (95% confidence interval [ CI], 0.49-0.60). For the prediction of significant coronary artery disease with hs-cTn elevation AUC: 0.54 (95% CI, 0.40-0.67), and without hs-cTn elevation AUC: 0.45 (95% CI, 0.31-0.59). When assessed by experienced physicians, specificity for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was higher at 65.8% (95% CI, 63.1%-68.7%) vs 55.4% (95% CI, 53.9%-56.8%) for novices.CONCLUSIONS: Subjective interpretation of ""typicality of chest pain"" is of limited discriminatory value in the assessment of suspected acute coronary syndromes, in the context of a nondiagnostic electrocardiogram.

Method: Fifty-eight community-based addiction clinicians (M = 42.1 years, SD = 10.0; 66% Female) were assessed prior to enrolling in a 2-day MI training workshop and being randomized to one of three post-workshop supervision programs: live supervision via tele-conferencing (TCS), standard tape-based supervision (Tape), or workshop training alone. Audiotaped sessions with clients were rated for MI skillfulness with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) coding system v 2.0 at pre-workshop and 1, 8, and 20 weeks post-workshop. Correlation coefficients and generalized linear models were used to test the relationships between clinician characteristics and MI skill at each assessment point. Results: Baseline MI skill levels were the most robust predictors of pre- and post-supervision performances. Clinician characteristics were associated with MI Spirit and reflective listening skill throughout training and moderated the effect of post-workshop supervision method on MI skill. TCS, which provided immediate feedback during practice sessions, was most effective for increasing MI Spirit and reflective listening among clinicians with no graduate degree and stronger vocabulary performances. Tape supervision was more effective for increasing these skills among clinicians with a graduate degree. Further, TCS and Tape were most likely to enhance MI Spirit among clinicians with low average to average verbal and abstract reasoning performances. Conclusions: Clinician attributes influence the effectiveness of methods used to promote the acquisition of evidence-based practices among community-based practitioners.

9,787,9,"We estimated human observer linear templates underlying the detection of a realistic, spherical mass signal with mammographic backgrounds. Five trained naive observers participated in two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) detection experiments with the signal superimposed on synthetic, clustered lumpy backgrounds (CLBs) in one condition and on nonstationary real mammographic backgrounds in another. Human observer linear templates were estimated using a genetic algorithm. A variety of common model observer templates were computed, and their shapes and associated performances were compared with those of the human observer. The estimated linear templates are not significantly different for stationary CLBs and real mammographic backgrounds. The estimated performance of the linear template compared with that of the human observers is within 5% in terms of percent correct (Pc) for the 2-AFC task. Channelized Hotelling models can fit human performance, but the templates differ considerably from the human linear template. Due to different local statistics, detection efficiency is significantly higher on nonstationary real backgrounds than on globally stationary synthetic CLBs. This finding emphasizes that nonstationary backgrounds need to be described by their local statistics.

9,788,9,"The research aim was to test the Job Demand–Control (JDC) Model demands × Control interaction (or buffering) hypothesis in a simulated bus driving experiment. The buffering hypothesis was tested using a 2 (low and high demands) × 2 (low and high decision latitude) design with repeated measures on the second factor. A sample of 80 bus operators were randomly assigned to the low (n = 40) and high demands (n = 40) conditions. Demands were manipulated by increasing or reducing the number of stops to pick up passengers, and decision latitude by imposing or removing restrictions on the Rapid Transit Bus (BRT) operators’ pace of work. Outcome variables include physiological markers (heart rate [HR], heart rate variability [HRV], breathing rate [BR], electromyography [EMG], and skin conductance [SC]), objective driving performance and self-report measurements of psychological wellbeing (psychological distress, interest/enjoyment [I/E], perceived competence, effort/importance [E/I], and pressure/tension [P/T]). It was found that job decision latitude moderates the effect of job demands on both physiological arousal (BR: F(1, 74) = 4.680, p = .034, SC: F(1, 75) = 6.769, p = .011, and EMG: F(1, 75) = 6.550, p = .013) and psychological well-being (P/T: F(1, 75) = 4.289, p = .042 and I/E: F(1, 74) = 4.548, p = .036). Consistently with the JDC model buffering hypothesis, the experimental findings suggest that increasing job decision latitude can moderate the negative effect of job demands on different psychophysiological outcomes.

This study aims to investigate the relationship of medical student NT skills and clinical performance during acute care team simulation (ACTS).Methods: Forty-one medical students participated in ACTS. A nurse confederate facilitated and evaluated clinical performance. Two raters assessed participants' NT skills using an adapted NT assessment tool and overall NT skills score was calculated. Regressions predicting clinical performance using NT constructs were conducted.Results: Overall NT skills score significantly predicted students' clinical performance (r(2) = 0.178, p = 0.006). Four of the five individual NT constructs also significantly predicted performance: communication (r(2) = 0.120, p = 0.027), situation awareness (r(2) = 0.323, p < 0.001), leadership (r(2) = 0.133, p = 0.019), and decision making (r(2) = 0.163, p = 0.009).Conclusions: Medical student NT skills can predict clinical performance during ACTS.

To address this assessment issue, we conducted exploratory factor analysis and Rasch analysis to assess the psychometric characteristics of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES, Rosenberg, 1965) for African American college students. The dimensional structure of the RSES was first identified with the first subsample (i.e., calibration subsample) and then held up under cross-validation with a second subsample (i.e., validation subsample). Exploratory factor analysis and Rasch analysis both supported unidimensionality of the measure, with that finding replicated for a random split of the sample. Response scale use was generally appropriate, items were endorsed at a high level reflecting high levels of self-esteem, and person separation and reliability of person separation were adequate, and reflected results similar to those found in prior research. However, as some categories were infrequently used, we also collapsed scale points and found a slight improvement in scale and item indices. No differential item functioning was found by sex or having received professional assistance versus not; there were no mean score differences by age group, marital status, or year in college.

This paper aims to investigate the group differences for two types of investors' groups, i.e. individual investors and professional investors.Design/methodology/approach - The study uses partial least square-based structural equation modeling technique, measurement invariance test and multigroup analysis test on a unique data set of 277 active equity traders which included professional money managers and individual investors.Findings - Results showed that salience has a significant positive impact on both short-term and long-term investment decisions. The impact was almost 1.5 times higher for long-term investment decision as compared to short-term decision. Furthermore, multigroup analysis revealed that the two groups (individual investors and professional investors) were statistically significantly different from each other.Research limitations/implications - The study has implications for financial regulators, money managers and individual investors as it was found that individual investors suffer more with salience heuristic and may end up with sub-optimal portfolios due to inefficient diversification. Thus, investors should be cautious in fully relying on salience and avoid such bias to improve investment returns.Practical implications - The study concludes with a discussion of policy and regulatory implications on how to minimize salience bias to achieve optimum and diversified portfolios.Originality/value - The study has significantly contributed to the growing body of applied behavioral research in the discipline of finance.",Chaudary,2019,Does salience matter in investment decision?: Differences between individual and professional investors,KYBERNETES,48,1894,1912,Web of Science,"Chaudary, Samra"
,796,2,"X-ray screening of passenger baggage is a key component in aviation security. The current study investigated how experts and novices performed in an X-ray baggage screening task while being assisted by an adaptable diagnostic aid. Furthermore, it examined how both groups operated and trusted this automated system. 30 experts (certified screeners) and 31 novices (students) had to indicate whether a target item (either a knife or a gun) was present in a series of X-ray images of cabin baggage. Half of the participants could choose between three different support levels of the diagnostic aid (DA): (1) no support, (2) a cue indicating the presence of a potential target without locating it, or (3) a cue indicating the presence of a potential target by surrounding it with a red frame. As expected, experts achieved higher detection performance (d'), were more self-confident and felt more competent in achieving the task than novices. Furthermore, experts experienced less time pressure and fatigue. Although both groups used the DA in a comparable way (in terms of support level used and frequency of level switches), results showed a performance increase for novices working with the DA compared to novices without support. This benefit of DA was not observed for experts. Interestingly, despite no difference in perceived trust ratings, experts were more compliant (i.e., following DA recommendations when it indicated the presence of a target) and reliant (i.e., following DA recommendations when it indicated the absence of a target) than novices. Altogether, the results of the present study suggested that novices benefited more from a DA than experts. Furthermore, compliance and reliance on DA seemed to depend on expertise with the task. Since experts should be better at assessing the reliability of the DA than novices, they may have used the DA as 'back-up' to confirm their decisions based on expertise (confirmatory function), while novices may have used it as a guide to base their decisions on (support function).

9,798,1,"Experience with visual stimuli can improve their perceptual performance, a phenomenon termed visual perceptual learning (VPL). VPL has been found to improve metacognitive measures, suggesting increased conscious accessibility to the knowledge supporting perceptual decision-making. However, such studies have largely failed to control objective task accuracy, which typically correlates with metacognition. Here, using a staircase method to control this confound, we investigated whether VPL improves the metacognitive accuracy of perceptual decision-making. Across 3 days, subjects were trained to discriminate faces based on their high-level identity or low-level contrast. Holding objective accuracy constant across training days, perceptual thresholds decreased in both tasks, demonstrating VPL in our protocol. However, whilemetacognitive accuracy was not affected by face contrast VPL, it was decreased by face identity VPL. Our findings couldbe parsimoniously explained by a dual-stage signal detection theory-based model involving an initial perceptual decision-making stage and a second confidence judgment stage. Within this model, internal noise reductions for both stages accounts for our face contrast VPL result, while only first stage noise reductions accounts for our face identity VPL result. In summary, we found evidence suggesting that conscious knowledge accessibility was improved by the VPL of face contrast but not face identity.",Chen,2019,Metacognitive Accuracy Improves With the Perceptual Learning of a Low- but Not High-Level Face Property,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,10,,,Web of Science,"Chen, Benjamin; Mundy, Matthew; Tsuchiya, Naotsugu"

There have been numerous academic studies of inter-observer variation in species-inventory and habitat mapping, but studies addressing the prevalence of inter-observer variation and consequences of poor quality data in professional practice are lacking. This paper addresses these questions via a questionnaire survey of environmental professionals, using the standard Phase 1 and National Vegetation Classification (NVC) survey methods in the United Kingdom. The survey revealed that misidentification of habitat types within survey reports was relatively common (approximating to 20% of all reports seen by respondents over the previous five years). Approximately 40% of respondents who had encountered erroneous reports stated that these had led to inaccurate initial site ecological assessments. Additional field surveys and discussions with surveyors were commonly used to resolve these issues, but for Phase 1 and NVC 26% and 34% of respondents, respectively, had encountered one or more cases where errors resulted in negative consequences for clients commissioning surveys (in terms of extra costs and project delays). Net loss of biodiversity arising from inaccurate reports was reported in at least one instance by 32% and 38% of respondents for Phase 1 and NVC surveys, respectively - results that may contribute to the attrition of natural capital within the UK.

9,803,9,"Objectives: To evaluate the effect of a multicomponent dementia care management program on primary care provider knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of quality of dementia care. Design: A clinic-level randomized, controlled trial of a comprehensive care management program for patients with dementia and their nonprofessional caregivers. The program included provider education and protocols for care managers to communicate with patients' medical providers. Setting: Sixteen clinics (eight intervention, eight usual care) in three healthcare systems in San Diego, California. Participants: Two hundred thirty-two medical providers; 129 from eight intervention clinics; 103 from eight usual-care clinics. Measurements: Providers were surveyed 9 months after intervention onset on knowledge (five items on four topics), attitudes about dementia (three items), and perception of quality of dementia care in their practice setting (three items). Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the differences between intervention and usual-care providers, adjusting for covariate effects across groups and clustering by clinic. Results: One hundred sixty-six of 232 (72%) providers responded. Intervention providers had better knowledge about assessing decision-making capacity than usual-care providers (adjusted difference in percentage correct=12%; adjusted odds ratio=2.4, 95% confidence interval=1.2- 4.8). Intervention providers viewed dementia patients as more difficult to manage in primary care than usual-care providers (P=.03). There were no other differences in knowledge, attitudes, or care quality perceptions across intervention and usual-care providers.

Hypotheses: We predicted that the participants would judge the expert’s evidence more positively when it had high validity and high reliability. Method: In Experiment 1, judges ( N = 111) and attorneys ( N = 95) read a summary of case facts and proffer of expert testimony on the intelligence of a litigant. The psychological testing varied in scientific quality; either there was (a) blind administration (i.e., the psychologist did not have an expectation for the test result) of a highly reliable test, (b) nonblind administration (i.e., the psychologist did have an expectation for the test result) of a highly reliable test, or (c) blind administration of a test with low reliability. In a trial simulation (Experiment 2), we varied the scientific quality of the intelligence test and whether the cross-examination addressed the scientific quality of the test. Results: The variations in scientific quality did not influence judges’ admissibility decisions nor their ratings of scientific quality nor did it influence attorneys’ decisions about whether to move to exclude the evidence. Attorneys’ ratings of scientific quality were sensitive to variations in reliability but not the testing conditions. Scientifically informed cross-examinations did not help mock jurors ( N = 192) evaluate the validity or the reliability of a psychological test.

9,805,4,"Background Medical education has shifted from memory-based practice to evidence-based decisions. The question arises: how can we ensure that all students get correct and systematic information? Visually based, computerised diagnostic decision support system (VCDDSS, VisualDx) may just fit our needs. A pilot study was conducted to investigate its role in medical education and clinical practice.Methods This was a prospective study, including one consultant dermatologist, 51 medical students and 13 dermatology residents, conducted in the dermatology teaching clinic at China Medical University Hospital from 30 December 2014 to 21 April 2015. Clinical diagnoses of 13 patients were made before and after using VCDDSS. Questionnaires were filled out at the end. The consultant dermatologist's diagnosis was defined as the standard answer; the Sign test was used to analyse diagnostic accuracy and the Fisher exact test to analyse questionnaires.Results There was an 18.75% increase in diagnostic accuracy after use of VCDDSS (62.5-81.25%; p value <0.01). Significant associations were found in diagnostic assistance in terms of user factors such as accessibility, interface satisfaction, quality of imaging, textual description, and a Chinese language interface option (p value<0.01).Conclusions This study demonstrated that VCDDSS increases diagnostic accuracy by 18.75%, which means we can avoid possible misdiagnosis, provide better treatment, and avoid waste of medical resources.

9,806,4,"This study examined the discussion of information among mixed-status clinical teams while constructing differential diagnoses. Twenty-four ad hoc teams, each consisting of a resident, an intern, and a third-year medical student, were given two hypothetical patient cases to discuss and diagnose. Prior to discussion, team members individually viewed different versions of a videotaped interview with a ""patient"" (trained actor). Each videotape contained some information that was present in all three versions (shared information) and some that was present in only that version (unique information). In addition, half of the time, the cases were constructed so that the unique information that appeared in only one tape was crucial for a correct diagnosis (a ""hidden profile"" condition). After viewing the videotapes, team members met to discuss the case and develop a differential diagnosis. Discussions were videotaped and analyzed. Overall, shared information was mentioned more often than unique information (p < 0.0001).

9,807,9,"L. R. Beach and T. R. Mitchell have proposed a contingency model for the selection of decision strategies. The strategy that the decision maker sees as offering the greatest expected net gain is the one selected (i.e., selection is based on a cost–benefit analysis). The present paper expands the range of applicability of this model, develops the selection mechanism in greater detail, examines the implications of variations in the costs and benefits, and presents the results of 2 studies that test some of these implications. In Exp I, 12 business school students were required to solve for (i.e., estimate) the expected profits a hypothetical person might realize in a written scenario. In Exp II, 10 similar Ss were asked to solve a set of 12 scenarios randomly selected from Exp I; 6 of the scenarios were solved using a high-complexity strategy and 6 were solved using a low-complexity one. Results of the 2 experiments are consistent with the predictions of the selection mechanism. Exp I showed that as the benefit of making a correct decision increased, problem solvers took more time to reach a solution and were more confident in their answers. Exp II showed that this result was not merely a direct effect of increased benefit and that the linkage was more complicated.

An analysis of the frequency of citations of good- and poor-performance articles cited in the Social Science Citation Index from 1972 through 1981 revealed that poor-performance articles were cited significantly more often than good-performance articles. 80 members of the Judgment and Decision Making Society, a semiformal professional group, were asked to complete a questionnaire assessing the overall quality of human judgment and decision-making abilities on a scale from 0 to 100 and to list 4 examples of documented poor judgment or decision-making performance and 4 examples of good performance. Ss recalled significantly more examples of poor than of good performance. Less experienced Ss in the field appeared to have a lower opinion of human reasoning ability than did highly experienced Ss. Also, Ss recalled 50% more examples of poor performance than of good performance, despite the fact that the variety of poor-performance examples was limited. It is concluded that there is a citation bias in the judgment and decision-making literature, and poor-performance articles are receiving most of the attention from other writers, despite equivalent proportions of each type in the journals.

When selecting which complications to mention to parents, physicians use a policy based on their subjective assessment of the frequency and seriousness of the complications' occurrence. Analyses revealed that the physicians' probability estimates were biased and their seriousness assessments were less than those expressed by 165 mothers of newborn sons. A comprehensive disclosure of unbiased information of possible risks and complications had no effect on the mothers' decisions to have their sons circumcised but did generate numerous influences on the mothers' attitudes.

Dysphagia screening reduces pneumonia threefold. Most nurse-screening tools have focused on stroke. However, many other conditions are associated with dysphagia. A multidisciplinary team developed a nurse-administered, evidence-based swallow screening tool for generic acute hospital use.Prospective, quasi-experimental.Nurses were assessed for knowledge pre- and post-training. All patients were nurse-screened for dysphagia on admission. All patients were reviewed by speech pathologists to determine screening accuracy. Results were not blinded. The one page tool encompassed (1) diagnostic categories, (2) patient/carer interview, (3) dysphagia indicators and (4) if applicable, water swallow test.Thirty-eight nurses participated in a seven-week study; 442 patients were screened on two general medical wards. Three speech pathologists counter-assessed each patient by clinical examination or chart review. Sensitivity was 95%; specificity was 97%. Positive predictive value was 92%; negative predictive value was 98%. 3.4% of clinical screening decisions were incorrect. Compliance rate was 85%.Caution is advised in interpretation of the results due to lack of blinding.

The study also examined the impact of contact with older patients on the making of these clinical decisions. Subjects were the entire nursing staff (N=186) of a general hospital in a northeastern American city. One-half of the sample responded to a vignette of a young person and one-half to a vignette of an old person with identical signs of emotional, behavioral, and perceptual disorder. The results support the notion that clinical decisions tend to be biased against old age and thus contribute to inappropriate labeling of the elderly. Results also suggest that when compared to subjects having little contact with old patients, those having considerable contact were more likely to believe that all patients, regardless of age, have an organic, incurable, and untreatable illness.

,814,2,"Background: Predicted patient life expectancy, based on a patient's medical history, is an important component of medical decision making. This study therefore aimed to determine the consistency, accuracy and precision with which doctors, nurses and medical students predict life expectancy (LE).Methods: 20 doctors, 20 nurses and 20 medical students (4th and 5th year) independently examined 70 hypothetical patient case scenarios containing age, sex and comorbidity: this included 13 duplicate scenarios. Accuracy and consistency of prediction was assessed by comparison with statistical LE estimates generated using evidence-based actuarial and life insurance industry methods in collaboration with a team of professional actuaries.Results: Doctors, nurses and medical students underestimated LE by a mean (95% confidence interval) of -1.46 (-0.31 to -2.61), -1.79 (-0.52 to -3.06) and -2.24 (-1.16 to -3.32) years with an equivalent root mean squared error (RMSE) of 4.74, 5.49 and 5.08 years respectively. LE predictions were equal to actuarial LE in less than 10% of cases and accurate to within 25% of actuarial LE in less than 45% of cases. Intraobserver reliability was 91%, 85% and 87% for doctors, nurses and medical students respectively. Interobserver reliability was 66%, 57% and 57% for the three groups.Conclusion: Doctors, nurses and medical students were inconsistent, inaccurate and imprecise in their prediction of LE with a tendency toward underestimation.

,816,2,"INTRODUCTION: Correct clinical decision-making is a key competency of surgical trainees. The purpose of this study was to assess validity and effect on resident decision-making accuracy of web-based virtual patient case scenarios in general surgery training.MATERIAL AND METHODS: During the 2013-2014 academic year, the use of web-based virtual patient scenarios for teaching and assessment of resident critical thinking and decision-making was assessed in 2 urban university-based residency programs. In all, 71 residents (PGY [postgraduate year] 1 = 21, PGY2 = 11, PGY3 = 14, PGY4 = 13, and PGY5 = 12) took the cases over the course of the academic year. Cases were made available to the residents online 1 week before a scheduled debriefing conference with a faculty facilitator and were completed by residents individually on their own schedule. At the completion of each case attempt, residents were given a computer-generated score and feedback. Residents were allowed to repeat the cases before the debriefing if they wished. Cases were required to be completed by 48 hours before the conference, at which time a faculty report was computer generated that measured group and individual performance and identified the frequency of errors in decision-making. This report was reviewed with the residents in the faculty debriefing, and teaching focused on the knowledge gaps identified in the reports.RESULTS: The mean percentage of assigned cases completed by categorical residents was 85.7%. Mean score (maximum possible = 100) on the cases increased by resident year (PGY1 = 45.3, PGY2 = 49.3, PGY3 = 53.6, PGY4 = 57.5, and PGY5 = 61.8), a 25% increase between PGY1 and PGY5 (p < 0.001 by analysis of variance). In all, 45 (63%) residents chose to repeat at least 1 case before the debriefing. The number of repetitions of individuals on the same case varied from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 5. On repeated cases, mean scores rose (attempt 1 = 22.6, attempt 2 = 69.3, attempt 3 = 72.1, attempt 4 = 77.5, attempt 5 = 100, p < 0.0001 by analysis of variance). Paired t tests on case repetition using each resident as his-her own control showed that scores rose by 46 points between attempt 1 and attempt 2 (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: (1) In a beta test of web-based scenarios that teach and assess clinical decision-making, resident scores improved by 25% from PGY 1 to PGY5 in a stepwise and statistically significant manner, suggesting that such exercises could serve as milestones for competency assessment. Additional studies are needed to acquire evidence for other forms of validity.

9,817,4,"Tax professionals provide valuable services to clients by reducing uncertainty about how clients should report transactions on their tax returns, To reduce uncertainty, tax professionals research applicable authorities (e.g., judicial precedents) and provide assessments to clients of the level of authoritative support for client-favorable positions. Tax professionals have strong incentives to make accurate assessments of the strength of client-preferred positions so that clients will understand the level of risk associated with the reporting position. Further, tax professionals must make accurate assessments of authoritative support in order to maintain compliance with tax professional standards and Federal income tax regulations. Incentives notwithstanding, psychological research on confirmation bias suggests that tax professionals' client advocacy role may inhibit professionals' ability to search objectively for relevant tax authority which, in turn, might inhibit their ability to accurately assess authoritative support. We report the results of two studies that examine causes and effects of confirmation bias in tax information search. In study 1, we find that subjects' information searches emphasized cases with conclusions consistent with the client's desired outcome (i,e, positive cases) over cases inconsistent with the client's desired outcome (i,e., negative cases), despite the fact that positive cases were no more similar to the client's facts. Additional analyses indicate that the extent of this confirmation bias was positively related to their assessments of the likelihood that a neutral court would resolve the issue in the client's favor and this in turn increased the strength with which they recommended the client's preferred tax position. Results of study 2 indicate that confirmation bias induced by client preferences can be strong enough to not only result in inaccurate assessments of authoritative support for the client-favored position, which is problematic in and of itself, but also to lead tax professionals to make overly aggressive recommendations.",Cloyd,1999,"The influence of client preferences on tax professionals' search for judicial precedents, subsequent judgments and recommendations",ACCOUNTING REVIEW,74,299,322,Web of Science,"Cloyd, CB; Spilker, BC"

However, there is still little standardization of the criteria upon which such a decision should be based. The impact of this lack of practice guidelines on the recommendation of surgery in clinical practice is unclear. The objective of the present study was to investigate the recommendation of surgical therapy during the corrective/reparative treatment phase by trained clinicians with various backgrounds on the basis of clinical data.Material and Methods: Fifteen clinicians (10 periodontal students and/or recent graduates from two dental schools and. ve experienced practitioners) were asked to make a treatment decision (surgery or no surgery) at a tooth level. Therefore, they were given 23 initially treated patients with details on demographics and smoking habits. Radiographs and clinical information on 573 teeth at baseline (prior to root debridement) and at 9 mo of follow-up were provided.Results: Clinicians interpret clinical data quite differently in their advice of surgery when practice guidelines are not provided, as the results showed high variation in surgical recommendation. Experienced practitioners showed most variation, with a range from 13 to 50% in surgical recommendation. Clinicians linked to a training center shared a common treatment philosophy as to when periodontal surgery should be performed. This philosophy differed markedly among the two dental schools. Most disagreement among the 15 clinicians was found for deep pockets and for multirooted teeth. Disease status, tooth type, age, and full-mouth plaque levels had a significant impact on decision making.Conclusion: The substantial variation in recommending surgery calls for consensus statements on surgical treatment.",Cosyn,2007,Interclinician disparity in periodontal decision making: need for consensus statements on surgical treatment,JOURNAL OF PERIODONTAL RESEARCH,42,311,317,Web of Science,"Cosyn, J.; De Bruyn, H."

Ss' performance was assessed by measures of response time and correct response time, and measures of heart rate were used to determine physiological response. Results indicate that Ss were able to maintain classification accuracy despite considerable variations in the time constraints of the task. Heart rate variability was the only measure that was sensitive to the differences in pacing conditions. The subjective measures (e.g., body part discomfort frequency, perceived exertion) were not affected by pacing conditions but exhibited trends toward increasing postural discomfort, fatigue, and boredom from the beginning to the end of each condition.

The present study evaluated the preliminary effectiveness of a web-mediated suicide prevention training program for an interdisciplinary set of mental health service providers. This pilot training project also advanced the literature by evaluating a suicide-related individual difference: the provider’s need for affect (NFA). Participant NFA was evaluated as a moderator of training effectiveness. Predictors of intent to utilize training content were also identified. Mental health professionals ( n = 43; 18.0% response rate; majority psychologists) completed the training program. The intervention consisted of a 12-module self-paced didactic and case study-based training. Training demonstrated meaningfully sized gains in suicide prevention knowledge, perceived skills/abilities, accuracy in suicide risk judgments, and reduction in negative feelings toward patients. NFA moderated several training gains. In general, participants willing to engage emotional content benefited more from training than affectively avoidant counterparts. Posttraining self-rated suicide prevention skills and confidence in training predicted intent to use training content. The training program requires further testing, but may offer a comprehensive, user-friendly CE training program for mental health service providers. NFA findings suggest potential to tailor future training, or to identify individual differences that may need to be accounted for in clinical training and supervision.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the biasing role of candidates' attractiveness - in facial and bodily terms - on perceived main personality features (i.e. core evaluations (CEs)) in selection decisions.Design/methodology/approach - An experimental study involving professional recruiters (n = 150) was conducted. Participants were asked to rate bodily attractiveness (using the objectification construct), CEs, facial attractiveness and hiring scores of six candidates for an administrative position; then, a moderated mediation model was tested.Findings - This study suggests that recruiters' perception of candidates' CEs mediates the relationship between objectification (i.e. body attractiveness) and the assigned hiring score, while facial attractiveness amplifies or reduces the effect of objectification on CEs.Originality/value - The value added of this contribution lies in studying the biasing mechanism of candidates' overall attractiveness (facial and bodily) and its effects on the perceived core personality features.",Cristofaro,2017,Candidates' attractiveness in selection decisions: a laboratory experiment,BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT,12,390,407,Web of Science,"Cristofaro, Matteo"
9,834,9,"In this study we compared two cognitive processes that are often thought to precede leadership perceptions: causal attributions and categorization. This was done by experimentally manipulating factors relevant to attributions (consensus information) and categorization (stimulus prototypicality). Dependent measures were undergraduate subjects' perceptions of the leadership exhibited by stimulus people, shown on a 12-min videotape of a management group. The interaction of the leader prototypicality and consensus information factors on leadership perceptions was opposite to that predicted by attribution theory. The experimental evidence suggested that the interaction effect was based on subjects' categorization of stimuli in terms of leadership. A methodology developed to measure encoding of on-going leader behavior allowed tests of the social-information-processing sequence involved in forming leadership perceptions. Results support recent propositions of social-information-processing theory and demonstrated the usefulness of the encoding methodology.

Our findings demonstrate that the processes controlling routine actions in the domain of skilled typing can be flexibly manipulated by memory processes coding recent experience with typing particular words and letters. In two experiments, we extended Masson's (1986) procedure for measuring item-specific learning in the context of acquiring an unfamiliar skill to the highly skilled domain of typing. Skilled typists' performance improved during practice with typing words composed from a specific set of letters. In a transfer phase, performance was fastest for trained words, followed by new words composed of trained letters, and slowest for new words composed of untrained letters.

It is hypothesized that the documentation task stimulates greater effort, attention, comprehension and recall of information relevant to the formation of audit judgments, causing those judgments to be less subject to recency bias. Seventy-five experienced audit professionals participated in an experiment involving judgments and decisions relating to the going-concern issue for a hypothetical audit client. Consistent with prior research, a recency effect did arise in the audit judgments of the no-documentation subjects. However, as predicted, this recency effect disappeared among subjects who performed the documentation task. This result suggests that, contrary to prior research, auditors are not likely to bias their judgments in real audit settings in response to the order in which they receive and evaluate evidence.",Cushing,1996,Mitigation of recency bias in audit judgment: The effect of documentation,AUDITING-A JOURNAL OF PRACTICE & THEORY,15,110,122,Web of Science,"Cushing, BE; Ahlawat, SS"
9,843,1,"Introduction: Triage is the systematic prioritization of casualties when there is an imbalance between the needs of these casualties and resource availability. The triage sieve is a recognized process for prioritizing casualties for treatment during mass-casualty incidents (MCIs). While the application of a triage sieve generally is well-accepted, the measurement of its accuracy has been somewhat limited. Obtaining reliable measures for triage sieve accuracy rates is viewed as a necessity for future development in this area.Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate how theoretical knowledge acquisition and the practical application of an aide-memoir impacted triage sieve accuracy rates.Method: Two hundred and ninety-two paramedics were allocated randomly to one of four separate sub-groups, a non-intervention control group, and three intervention groups, which involved them receiving either an educational review session and/or an aide-memoir. Participants were asked to triage sieve 20 casualties using a previously trialed questionnaire.Results: The study showed the non-intervention control group had a correct accuracy rate of 47%, a similar proportion of casualties found to be under-triaged (37%), but a significantly lower number of casualties were over-triaged (16%). The provision of either an educational review or aide-memoir significantly increased the correct triage sieve accuracy rate to 77% and 90%, respectively. Participants who received both the educational review and aide-memoir had an overall accuracy rate of 89%. Over-triaged rates were found not to differ significantly across any of the study groups.Conclusion: This study supports the use of an aide-memoir for maximizing MCI triage accuracy rates. A ""just-in-time"" educational refresher provided comparable benefits, however its practical application to the MCI setting has significant operational limitations. In addition, this study provides some guidance on triage sieve accuracy rate measures that can be applied to define acceptable performance of a triage sieve during a MCI.",Cuttance,2017,Paramedic Application of a Triage Sieve: A Paper-Based Exercise,PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE,32,3,13,Web of Science,"Cuttance, Glen; Dansie, Kathryn; Rayner, Tim"

Six chief residents performed 3 simulated procedures: bowel anastomosis, laparoscopic ventral hernia (LVH) repair, and pancreaticojejunostomy. Faculty assessed resident performance using task-specific checklists, Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS), and final product analysis.RESULTS: Residents' individual task-specific checklist scores ranged from 25% to 100% across all 3 procedures. Mean OSATS scores ranged from 4.06 to 4.23/5.0. Residents scored significantly higher on ""instrument knowledge"" (mean = 4.78, standard deviation [SD] = 23) than ""time and motion'' (mean = 3.94, SD = .48, P = .025) and ""ability to adapt to individual pathologic circumstances"" (mean = 4.06, SD = .12, P = .002). Final product analysis revealed a range of errors, including incorrect technique and poor intraoperative planning.CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively high OSATS ratings, residents had a wide range of errors and procedure outcomes.

The sample included 77 Australian police officers specialising in sexual assault investigation. The training, delivered face to face over 4 weeks, included focus on identifying elements of grooming in offending relationships and how these elements can be elicited from victims and suspects within a narrative interviewing framework. Officers' perceptions of cases were assessed immediately pre- and post- training using a series of case scenarios. For each scenario, officers rated (on a 10-point Likert-type scale) their confidence that the case should be authorised to proceed to prosecution and the responsibility attributable to the victim. For each case, officers also listed up to 5 factors to justify their case authorization decision. Overall, confidence in case authorization increased from pre- to posttraining, whilst perception of victim responsibility decreased. The pattern of results, including the qualitative evidence to justify officers' decisions, support that the attitude change was due to greater understanding of the dynamics of sexual offending.

9,849,4,"This study of the custody recommendations of 130 social workers in Israel shows that they generally recommended custody with the parent with whom the child was expected to have the higher quality of life, whose economic status was better, who had fewer emotional, physical, and cognitive problems, and who were not engaged in criminal activity. The findings also show, however, that the disparities in the child's expected QOL with each of his/her parents had significantly greater explanatory power than that of these parental features and, moreover, that the parental features added little to its explanatory power. These findings highlight the importance of expected quality of life in custody decisions as well as the utility of the Systemic Quality of Life Model for examining and explaining custody decisions. In addition, the findings show that mothers who were poor or who had cognitive or psychological problems were around three times more likely to be awarded custody than fathers in the same situation.

In this field study, we examined relationships between jury verdicts and variables representing 3 classes of potential determinants—evidentiary, extraevidentiary, and deliberation process—using a sample of 114 criminal jury trials. Posttrial data were collected from 11 presiding judges, 31 attorneys, and 367 jurors using a Web-based questionnaire. The strength of the prosecution’s evidence was strongly related to the occurrence of a conviction, whereas most extraevidentiary and deliberation process variables were only weakly to modestly related in bivariate form and when the prosecution’s evidence strength was controlled. Notable exceptions to this pattern were jury demographic diversity as represented by the number of different race-gender subgroups (e.g., Black males) present in the jury, and several deliberation process variables reflecting advocacy for acquittal (e.g., presence of an identifiable proacquittal faction within the jury and proacquittal advocacy by the foreperson).

The tradeoffs in flexibility, fidelity, and cost raise an interesting development decision: which speech approach is most appropriate for virtual patients? Two groups of medical students participated in a user study interviewing a virtual patient under each condition. We found no significant differences in the overall impression, speech intelligibility, and task performance. Our conclusion is that if the goal is to train students of which questions to ask, synthesized speech is just as effective as recorded speech. However, if the goal is to teach the student how to ask the correct questions, a high level of expressiveness in the virtual patient is needed. This in turn necessitates the higher cost-even with the lower flexibility-of recorded speech.",Dickerson,2006,Virtual Patients: Assessment of Synthesized Versus Recorded Speech,MEDICINE MEETS VIRTUAL REALITY 14: ACCELERATING CHANGE IN HEALTHCARE: NEXT MEDICAL TOOLKIT,119,114,+,Web of Science,"Dickerson, Robert; Johnsen, Kyle; Raij, Andrew; Lok, Benjamin; Stevens, Amy; Bernard, Thomas; Linda, D.

These processes and practices present an emerging model of safe medication administration developed from the narratives of 50 medical-surgical nurses. This model provides researchers with the basis for the development of systemic policies for safer medication administration for patients.

9,873,9,"Objective: To explore home care nurses' numeracy and graph literacy and their relationship to comprehension of visualized data.Materials and Methods: A multifactorial experimental design using online survey software. Nurses were recruited from 2 Medicare-certified home health agencies. Numeracy and graph literacy were measured using validated scales. Nurses were randomized to 1 of 4 experimental conditions. Each condition displayed data for 1 of 4 quality indicators, in 1 of 4 different visualized formats (bar graph, line graph, spider graph, table). A mixed linear model measured the impact of numeracy, graph literacy, and display format on data understanding.Results: In all, 195 nurses took part in the study. They were slightly more numerate and graph literate than the general population. Overall, nurses understood information presented in bar graphs most easily (88% correct), followed by tables (81% correct), line graphs (77% correct), and spider graphs (41% correct). Individuals with low numeracy and low graph literacy had poorer comprehension of information displayed across all formats. High graph literacy appeared to enhance comprehension of data regardless of numeracy capabilities.Discussion and Conclusion: Clinical dashboards are increasingly used to provide information to clinicians in visualized format, under the assumption that visual display reduces cognitive workload. Results of this study suggest that nurses' comprehension of visualized information is influenced by their numeracy, graph literacy, and the display format of the data.

9,875,1,"BACKGROUND Acquisition of visual interpretation skills in cytopathology may involve 2 strategies. Analytic strategies require trainees to base their interpretive decisions on carefully considered and often exhaustive cytomorphologic feature lists, a process that can be time-consuming and inefficient. In contrast, nonanalytic pattern recognition strategies are rarely encouraged during training, even though this approach is characteristic of expert diagnostic behavior. This study evaluated the potential role of nonanalytic learning in cytopathology as an efficient alternative to analytic training. METHODS Forty-nine cytology novice participants undertook an initial image interpretation test to obtain baseline diagnostic accuracy (test 1). Twenty-four participants subsequently received training in basic cervical cytomorphology and were given a list of cell features for future reference (the analytic group). The remaining 25 participants were simply shown 20 nonannotated paired images of normal and abnormal cervical cells (the nonanalytic group). Following a practice phase, both groups were retested (test 2). Prior to a final test (test 3), participants in both groups were instructed to adopt a combined analytic/nonanalytic diagnostic strategy. Diagnostic accuracy and response times were measured in each test. RESULTS Diagnostic accuracy in both groups improved significantly between tests 1 and 2 (P<.001) but decreased between tests 2 and 3 (P<.05). Speed of response to test images was generally faster under nonanalytic than under analytic conditions. CONCLUSIONS Nonanalytic reasoning in cytopathology image interpretation can be as accurate as traditional feature-based reasoning. Encouraging trainees to adopt pattern recognition strategies may help to expedite the acquisition of visual interpretation skills in cytopathology training programs, yet combining analytic and nonanalytic reasoning do not appear to be effective.

They were then tested either on that domain or on another domain either immediately or after a 2-wk delay. Strong domain independence was found when testing was immediate. This transfer of training was not due simply to Ss' ability to draw direct analogies between problems in the trained domain and in the untrained domain. After the 2-wk delay, it was found that (1) there was no decline in performance in the trained domain and (2) although there was a significant decline in performance in the untrained domain, performance was still better than for control Ss.

9,878,9,"Background: Reminder systems in electronic patient records (EPR) have proven to affect both health care professionals' behaviour and patient outcomes. The aim of this cluster randomised trial was to investigate the effects of implementing a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for peripheral venous catheters (PVCs) in paediatric care in the format of reminders integrated in the EPRs, on PVC-related complications, and on registered nurses' (RNs') self-reported adherence to the guideline. An additional aim was to study the relationship between contextual factors and the outcomes of the intervention.Methods: The study involved 12 inpatient units at a paediatric university hospital. The reminders included choice of PVC, hygiene, maintenance, and daily inspection of PVC site. Primary outcome was documented signs and symptoms of PVC-related complications at removal, retrieved from the EPR. Secondary outcome was RNs' adherence to a PVC guideline, collected through a questionnaire that also included RNs' perceived work context, as measured by the Alberta Context Tool. Units were allocated into two strata, based on occurrence of PVCs. A blinded simple draw of lots from each stratum randomised six units to the control and intervention groups, respectively. Units were not blinded. The intervention group included 626 PVCs at baseline and 618 post-intervention and the control group 724 PVCs at baseline and 674 post-intervention. RNs included at baseline were 212 (65.4 %) and 208 (71.5 %) post-intervention.Results: No significant effect was found for the computer reminders on PVC-related complications nor on RNs' adherence to the guideline recommendations. The complication rate at baseline and post-intervention was 40.6 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 36.7-44.5) and 41.9 % (95 % CI 38.0-45.8), for the intervention group and 40.3 % (95 % CI 36.8-44.0) and 46.9 % (95 % CI 43.1-50.7) for the control. In general, RNs' self-rated work context varied from moderately low to moderately high, indicating that conditions for a successful implementation to occur were less optimal.Conclusions: The reminders might have benefitted from being accompanied by a tailored intervention that targeted specific barriers, such as the low frequency of recorded reasons for removal, the low adherence to daily inspection of PVC sites, and the lack of regular feedback to the RNs.",Forberg,2016,Effects of computer reminders on complications of peripheral venous catheters and nurses' adherence to a guideline in paediatric care-a cluster randomised study,IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE,11,,,Web of Science,"Forberg, Ulrika; Unbeck, Maria; Wallin, Lars; Johansson, Eva; Petzold, Max; Ygge, Britt-Marie; Ehrenberg, Anna"
9,879,9,"Background: Point-of-care ultrasonography (PoCUS) is a rapidly evolving discipline that aims to train non-cardiologists, non-radiologists clinicians in performing bedside ultrasound to guide clinical decision. Training of PoCUS is challenging, time-consuming and requires large amount of resources. The objective of our study was to evaluate if this training process can be simplified by allowing medical students self-train themselves with a web-based cardiac ultrasound software. Methods: A prospective, single blinded, cohort study, comparing performance of 29 medical students in performing a six-minutes cardiac ultrasound exam. Students were divided into two groups: self-learning group, using a combination of E-learning software and self-practice using pocket ultrasound device compared to formal, frontal cardiac ultrasound course. Results: All 29 students completed their designated courses and performed the six-minutes exam: 20 students participated in the frontal cardiac ultrasound course and 9 completed the self-learning course. The median (Q1,Q3) test score for the self-learning group was higher than the frontal course group score, 18 (15,19) versus 15 (12,19.5), respectively. Nevertheless, no statistically significant difference was found between the two study groups (p = 0.478). All students in the self-learning course group (9/9, 100%) and 16 (16/20, 80%) of students in the frontal ultrasound course group obtained correct alignment of the parasternal long axis view (p = 0.280). Conclusions: Self-learning students combining E-learning software with self-practice cardiac ultrasound were as good as students who received a validated, bedside, frontal cardiac ultrasound course. Our findings suggest that independent cardiac ultrasound learning, combining utilization of E±learning software and self-practice, is feasible. Self-E- learning of cardiac ultrasound may serve as an important, cost-effective adjunct to heavily resource consuming traditional teaching.

In this study we propose a framework for categorizing hematoxylin-eosin stained breast images either as benign or malignant at four magnification factors, and then aggregating the classification results of a patient's images from different magnification factors to make the ultimate diagnosis for each patient. We used a publicly available database, containing 7786 images from 81 patients.

Pathologists’ assessment of lesion subtypes is considered as the gold standard, however, sometimes strong disagreements among pathologists for distinction among lesion subtypes have been previously reported in the literature. Objective: To propose a framework for classifying hematoxylin-eosin stained breast digital slides either as benign or cancer, and then categorizing cancer and benign cases into four different subtypes each. Materials and methods: We used data from a publicly available database (BreakHis) of 81 patients where each patient had images at four magnification factors (× 40, × 100, × 200, and × 400) available, for a total of 7786 images. The proposed framework, called MuDeRN (MUlti-category classification of breast histopathological image using DEep Residual Networks) consisted of two stages. In the first stage, for each magnification factor, a deep residual network (ResNet) with 152 layers has been trained for classifying patches from the images as benign or malignant. In the next stage, the images classified as malignant were subdivided into four cancer subcategories and those categorized as benign were classified into four subtypes. Finally, the diagnosis for each patient was made by combining outputs of ResNets’ processed images in different magnification factors using a meta-decision tree. Results: For the malignant/benign classification of images, MuDeRN’s first stage achieved correct classification rates (CCR) of 98.52%, 97.90%, 98.33%, and 97.66% in × 40, × 100, × 200, and × 400 magnification factors respectively.

Teams consisted of surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses. Behaviour was assessed by four trained raters using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) and Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) rating scales before and during the crisis phase of each scenario. The primary endpoint was time to crisis resolution; secondary endpoints included NTS scores before and during the crisis. A cross-classified linear mixed-effects model was used for the final analysis.Results: Thirteen different surgical teams were assessed. Higher NTS ratings resulted in significantly faster crisis resolution. For anaesthetists, every 1-point increase in ANTS score was associated with a decrease of 53.50 (95 per cent c.i. 31.13 to 75.87) s in time to crisis resolution (P < 0.001). Similarly, for surgeons, every 1-point increase in NOTSS score was associated with a decrease of 64.81 (26.01 to 103.60) s in time to crisis resolution in the haemorrhage scenario (P = 0.001); however, this did not apply to the difficult airway scenario.

After reviewing each resumé, Ss completed a resumé evaluation questionnaire. Applicants' resumés varied only in disability status; 1 was described as nondisabled, 1 as paraplegic, and 1 as having a history of mental illness. Job descriptions varied only in the amount of social contact required by the position. Results demonstrate that the nature of the disability played a role in the recommendation for hiring process. There was a negative bias for the applicant with a history of mental illness when compared to the applicant with paraplegia, even when perceived qualifications, objective qualifications, and work history were equal. However, the applicant with paraplegia appeared to have an enhanced likelihood for being hired when compared to the nondisabled applicant.

,891,2,"Epidemiological evidence indicates that African Americans receive lower quality pain treatment than European Americans. However, the factors causing these disparities remain unidentified, and solutions to this problem remain elusive. Across three laboratory experiments, we examined the hypotheses that empathy is not only causing pain treatment disparities but that empathy-inducing interventions can reduce these disparities. Undergraduates (Experiments 1 and 2) and nursing professionals (Experiment 3) watched videos of real Black and White patients’ genuine facial expressions of pain, provided pain treatment decisions, and reported their feelings of empathy for each patient. The efficacy of an empathy-inducing, perspective-taking intervention at reducing pain treatment disparities was also examined (Experiments 2 and 3). When instructed to attempt to provide patients with the best care, participants exhibited significant pro-White pain treatment biases. However, participants engaged in an empathy-inducing, perspective-taking intervention that instructed them to imagine how patients’ pain affected patients’ lives exhibited upwards of a 55% reduction in pain treatment bias in comparison to controls. Furthermore, Pro-White empathy biases were highly predictive of pro-White pain treatment biases. The magnitude of the empathy bias experienced predicted the magnitude of the treatment bias exhibited. These findings suggest that empathy plays a crucial role in racial pain treatment disparities in that it appears not only to be one likely cause of pain treatment disparities but also is an important means for reducing racial disparities in pain treatment.

,892,2,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to determine the proficiency of emergency medicine residents in selecting appropriate radiologic examinations for specific clinical scenarios and to ascertain whether their training improves competency in this area over the course of their residency.MATERIALS AND METHODS. An online multiple-choice questionnaire was created. It included 10 clinical scenarios excerpted from the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria guidelines and instructed residents to select the most appropriate initial imaging study. A link and invitation to the survey were e-mailed to the residency program directors and coordinators of all American Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited emergency medicine residency training programs with the request that they be forwarded to their current residents. Responses were graded, with correct answers derived from the American College of Radiology guidelines. Results were stratified by year of emergency medicine training, and an analysis of variance was performed.RESULTS. A total of 583 residents from at least 77 different emergency medicine residency training programs completed the survey. Overall, the average number of questions answered correctly was 7.1 of 10 (SD, 1.2). First-through fourth-year residents averaged 6.9 (SD, 1.3), 7.1 (SD, 1.2), 7.1 (SD, 1.1), and 7.5 (SD, 1.1) correct answers, respectively. Analysis of variance found no significant difference between the scores of the four classes (p = 0.09).CONCLUSION.

,893,2,"International guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in adults advocate that cardiac arrest be recognized, within 5-10 s, by the absence of a pulse ill the carotid arteries. However, validation of first responders' assessment of the carotid pulse has begun only recently. We aimed (1) to develop a methodology to study diagnostic accuracy in detecting the presence or absence of the carotid pulse in unresponsive patients, and (2) to evaluate diagnostic accuracy and time required by first responders to assess the carotid pulse.In 16 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, four groups of first responders (EMT-1: 107 laypersons with basic life support (BLS) training; EMT-2: 16 emergency medical technicians (EMTs) in training; PM-1: 74 paramedics in training; PM-2: 9 certified paramedics) performed, single-blinded and randomly allocated, carotid pulse assessment either during spontaneous circulation, or during non-pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass. Time to diagnosis of carotid pulse status, concurrent haemodynamics and diagnostic accuracy were recorded.In 10% (6/59); an absent carotid pulse was not recognized as pulselessness. In 45% (66/147), a pulse was not identified despite a carotid pulse with a systolic pressure greater than or equal to 80 mmHg. Thus, although sensitivity of all participants for central pulselessness approached 90%, specificity was only 55%. Both sensitivity and, to a lesser degree, specificity improved with increasing training; blood pressure or heart rate had no significant effect. The median diagnostic delay was 24 s (minimum 3 s). When no carotid pulse was found. delays were significantly longer (30 s: minimum 13 s), than when a carotid pulse was identified (15 s; minimum 3 s) (P < 0.0001). Of all participants, only 15% (31/206) produced correct diagnoses within 10 s. Only 1/59 (2%) identified pulselessness correctly within 10 s.Our cardiopulmonary bypass model of carotid pulse assessment proved to be feasible and realistic. We conclude that recognition of pulselessness by rescuers with basic CPR training is time-consuming and inaccurate. Both intensive retraining of professional rescuers and reconsideration of guidelines about carotid pulse assessment are warranted.

9,894,4,"Introduction Sociodemographic differences have been observed in the treatment of extremely premature (periviable) neonates, but the source of this variation is not well understood. We assessed the feasibility of using simulation to test the effect of maternal race and insurance status on shared decision making (SDM) in periviable counseling.Methods We conducted a 2 x 2 factorial simulation experiment in which obstetricians and neonatologists counseled 2 consecutive standardized patients diagnosed with ruptured membranes at 23 weeks, counterbalancing race (black/white) and insurance status using random permutation. We assessed verisimilitude of the simulation in semistructured debriefing interviews. We coded physician communication related to resuscitation, mode of delivery, and steroid decisions using a 9-point SDM coding framework and then compared communication scores by standardized patient race and insurer using analysis of variance.Results Sixteen obstetricians and 15 neonatologists participated; 71% were women, 84% were married, and 75% were parents; 91% of the physicians rated the simulation as highly realistic. Overall, SDM scores were relatively high, with means ranging from 6.4 to 7.9 (of 9). There was a statistically significant interaction between race and insurer for SDM related to steroid use and mode of delivery (P < 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively). Between-group comparison revealed nonsignificant differences (P = <0.10) between the SDM scores for privately insured black patients versus privately insured white patients, Medicaid-insured white patients versus Medicaid-insured black patients, and privately insured black patients versus Medicaid-insured black patients.Conclusions This study confirms that simulation is a feasible method for studying sociodemographic effects on periviable counseling.

9,895,9,"In this study we compared the ethical attitudes of a group of experienced, predominantly female, registered nurses (n = 67) with those of a group of final year, mixed sex, medical students (n = 125). The purpose was to determine the basis of differences in attitudes that could lead to ethical disagreements between these two groups when they came to work together. A questionnaire developed to explore ethical attitudes was administered and the responses of the two groups were compared using t-tests. Because of the preponderance of females among the nurses an analysis of variance of the gender-adjusted scores for each group was also carried out. On comparing the responses, the nurses differed significantly from the medical students in a number of ethical domains. A potential source of conflict between these two groups is that the nurses were inclined to adopt the perspective of patients but the medical students identified with their profession. When corrected for the effects of gender, the differences persisted, indicating that it was discipline that determined the differences. We recommend that students of nursing and medicine receive ethics education together, and that more open dialogue between doctors and nurses with respect to their different ethical viewpoints is needed in the work setting.

Comparisons were made between data collected from physicians at enrollment of a prospective cohort study and self-declarations of 196 HIV-IDUs who have been prescribed ART. The likelihood of being perceived 'adherent' by physicians was higher for women, patients of 30 yrs of age or older, with biological markers indicative of a healthier status, and who were perceived as 'free of injecting behavior' and not in drug maintenance treatment. Although the proportion of non-adherent patients was similar in physicians' assessment (26.%) and patients' self-declarations (27%), a strong discordance occurred: 60.4% of patients self-reporting non-adherence to ART (80% for those receiving a protease inhibitor) were classified as adherent by their prescribing physicians. The study suggests that a priori judgements based on clinical experience but also on social stereotypes interfere with physicians' assessment, and that physicians' decisions to initiate complex treatment regimens may further induce optimistic biases and an underestimation of the problems faced by IDU patients to adequately adhere to them.

9,898,9,"Objectives: Evaluators examining the same evidence often arrive at substantially different conclusions in forensic assessments of child sexual abuse (CSA). This study attempts to identify and quantify subjective factors that contribute to such disagreements so that interventions can be devised to improve the reliability of case decisions. Methods: Participants included 1106 professionals in the field of child maltreatment representing a range of professional positions or job titles and years of experience. Each completed the Child Forensic Attitude Scale (CFAS), a 28-item survey assessing 3 forensic attitudes believed to influence professional judgments about CSA allegations: emphasis-on-sensitivity (i.e., a focus on minimizing false negatives or errors of undercalling abuse); emphasis-on-specificity (i.e., a focus on minimizing false positives or errors of overcalling abuse); and skepticism toward child and adolescent reports of CSA. A subset of 605 professionals also participated in 1 of 3 diverse decision exercises to assess the influence of the 3 forensic attitudes on ratings of case credibility. Results: Exploratory factor analysis identified 4 factors or attitude subscales that corresponded closely with the original CFAS scales: 2 subscales for emphasis-on-sensitivity and 1 each for emphasis-on-specificity and skepticism. Attitude subscale scores differed significantly by sample source (in-state trainings vs. national conferences), gender, years of experience, and professional position, with Child Protective Service workers unexpectedly more concerned about overcalling abuse and more skeptical of child disclosures than other professionals—a pattern of scores associated with an increased probability of disbelieving CSA allegations. The 3 decision exercises offered validation of the attitude subscales as predictors of professional ratings of case credibility, with adjusted R2s for the three exercises ranging from .06 to .24, suggesting highly variable effect sizes. Conclusions: Evaluator disagreements about CSA allegations can be explained, in part, by individual differences in 3 attitudes related to forensic decision-making: emphasis-on-sensitivity, emphasis-on-specificity, and skepticism toward child reports of abuse. These attitudes operate as predispositions or biases toward viewing CSA allegations as likely true or likely false. Several strategies for curbing the influence of subjective factors are highlighted including self-awareness of personal biases and team approaches to assessment.

Design Prospective case-based evaluation. Setting Academic medical center with 320 beds. Subjects Medical house staff (MDs) and ICU nurses (RNs) from one center and select critical care pharmacists (PHs). Intervention Completion of a survey containing 10 hypothetical ICU cases in which patients had agitated delirium for which a psychiatrist recommended intravenous haloperidol 5mg every 6hours. Each case contained different potential risk factor(s) for TdP in specific combinations. A group of five EP cardiologists agreed that haloperidol use was safe in five cases and not safe in five cases. Measurements and Main Results For each case, participants were asked to document whether they would administer haloperidol, to provide a rationale for their decision, and to state their level of confidence in that decision. Most clinicians (92 of 115 [80%]) invited to participate completed the cases. Among the five cases where EP cardiologists agreed that haloperidol was not safe, 29% of respondents felt that haloperidol was safe. Conversely, in the five cases where EP cardiologists felt haloperidol was safe, 21% of respondents believed that it was not safe. Overall respondent-EP cardiologist agreement for haloperidol use across the 10 cases was moderate (=0.51). MDs and PHs were in agreement with the EP cardiologists more than RNs (p=0.03).

9,904,9,"Patients engaging in shared decision making must weigh the likelihood of positive and negative outcomes and deal with uncertainty and negative emotions in the situations where desirable options might not be available. The use of ""nudges,"" or communication techniques that influence patients' choices in a predictable direction, may assist patients in making complex decisions. However, nudging patients may be perceived as inappropriate influence on patients' choices. We sought to determine whether key stakeholders, physicians, and laypersons without clinical training consider the use of nudges to be ethical and appropriate in medical decision making. Eighty-nine resident-physicians and 336 Mechanical-Turk workers (i.e., non-clinicians) evaluated two hypothetical preference-sensitive situations, in which a patient with advanced cancer chooses between chemotherapy and hospice care. We varied the following: (1) whether or not the patient's decision was influenced by a mistaken judgment (i.e., decision-making bias) and (2) whether or not the physician used a nudge. Each participant reported the extent to which the communication was ethical, appropriate, and desirable. Both physicians and non-clinicians considered using nudges more positively than not using them, regardless of an initial decision-making bias in patients' considerations. Decomposing this effect, we found that physicians viewed the nudge that endorsed hospice care more favorably than the nudge that endorsed chemotherapy, while non-clinicians viewed the nudge that endorsed chemotherapy more favorably than the nudge that endorsed hospice care. We discuss implications and propose exploring further physicians' and patients' differences in the perception of nudges; the differences may suggest limitations for using nudges in medical decisions.

9,905,4,"When making decisions under uncertainty, it is important to distinguish between the probability that a judgment is true and the confidence analysts possess in drawing their conclusions. Yet analysts and decision‐makers often struggle to define “confidence” in this context, and many ways that scholars use this term do not necessarily facilitate decision‐making under uncertainty. To help resolve this confusion, we argue for disaggregating analytic confidence along three dimensions: reliability of available evidence, range of reasonable opinion, and responsiveness to new information. After explaining how these attributes hold different implications for decision‐making in principle, we present survey experiments examining how analysts and decision‐makers employ these ideas in practice. Our first experiment found that each conception of confidence distinctively influenced national security professionals' evaluations of high‐stakes decisions. Our second experiment showed that inexperienced assessors of uncertainty could consistently discriminate among our conceptions of confidence when making political forecasts. We focus on national security, where debates about defining “confidence levels” have clear practical implications. But our theoretical framework generalizes to nearly any area of political decision‐making, and our empirical results provide encouraging evidence that analysts and decision‐makers can grasp these abstract elements of uncertainty.

We hypothesized that perpetrators high on uncertainty avoidance would respond better to negotiators who use formal language and legitimize their position with reference to law, procedures, and moral codes. Data were transcriptions of 53 negotiations from a Dutch–German police training initiative, where police negotiators interacted with a high (German) and low (Dutch) uncertainty-avoidant mock perpetrator. Consistent with accounts of cross-cultural interaction, negotiators tended to achieve more alignment in within-culture interactions compared to cross-cultural interactions. Moreover, German negotiators, who scored higher on uncertainty avoidance than the Dutch negotiators, were found to use more legitimizing messages and more formal language than their Dutch counterparts. Critically, irrespective of the negotiators cultural background, the use of these behaviors was a significant moderator of the degree to which negotiator and perpetrator aligned their communicative frames: Using legitimizing and formal language helped with German perpetrators but had no effect on Dutch perpetrators. Our findings show the effects of cultural background on communication alignment and demonstrate the benefits of using more formal language and messages that emphasize law and regulations when interacting with perpetrators high on uncertainty avoidance.

9,911,4,"Background: Medical decision making may be influenced by contextual factors. We evaluated whether pathologists are influenced by disease severity of recently observed cases. Methods: Pathologists independently interpreted 60 breast biopsy specimens (one slide per case; 240 total cases in the study) in a prospective randomized observational study. Pathologists interpreted the same cases in 2 phases, separated by a washout period of &gt;6 months. Participants were not informed that the cases were identical in each phase, and the sequence was reordered randomly for each pathologist and between phases. A consensus reference diagnosis was established for each case by 3 experienced breast pathologists. Ordered logit models examined the effect the pathologists’ diagnoses on the preceding case or the 5 preceding cases had on their diagnosis for the subsequent index case. Results: Among 152 pathologists, 49 provided interpretive data in both phases I and II, 66 from only phase I, and 37 from phase II only. In phase I, pathologists were more likely to indicate a more severe diagnosis than the reference diagnosis when the preceding case was diagnosed as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive cancer (proportional odds ratio [POR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15–1.42). Results were similar when considering the preceding 5 cases and for the pathologists in phase II who interpreted the same cases in a different order compared with phase I (POR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05–1.31). Conclusion: Physicians appear to be influenced by the severity of previously interpreted test cases. Understanding types and sources of diagnostic bias may lead to improved assessment of accuracy and better patient care.

9,913,9,"Objective: The research determined the usage and satisfaction levels with one of two point-of-care (PoC) resources among health care providers in a rural state.Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, twenty-eight health care providers in rural areas were stratified by occupation and region, then randomized into either the DynaMed or the AccessMedicine study arm. Study participants were physicians, physician assistants, and nurses. A pre- and post-study survey measured participants' attitudes toward different information resources and their information-seeking activities. Medical student investigators provided training and technical support for participants. Data analyses consisted of analysis of variance (ANOVA), paired t tests, and Cohen's d statistic to compare pre- and post-study effects sizes.Results: Participants in both the DynaMed and the AccessMedicine arms of the study reported increased satisfaction with their respective PoC resource, as expected. Participants in both arms also reported that they saved time in finding needed information. At baseline, both arms reported too little information available, which increased to ""about right amounts of information'' at the completion of the study. DynaMed users reported a Cohen's d increase of +1.50 compared to AccessMedicine users' reported use of 0.82.

Results showed that participants in both conditions improved significantly in terms of their diagnostic scores from pre-test to post-test. More importantly, participants in the Considering Alternatives condition outperformed those in the Playback condition in the accuracy of their confidence judgments and the discrimination of the correctness of their assertions while solving cases.

9,915,9,"Background: Computerized decision support systems (CDSSs) have been shown to help health care professionals to avoid errors and improve clinical practice and efficiency in health care. Little is known about its influence on nursing practice and outcomes for residents in nursing homes.Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on the risk for and prevalence of pressure ulcers (PUs) and malnutrition of implementing a CDSS to improve prevention and care of PUs and also to improve nutrition in the elderly in nursing homes.Design setting and participants: The study used a quasi-experimental design with two intervention groups and one control group. A convenience sample of residents from 46 units in 15 nursing homes in rural areas in Norway was included. A total of 491 residents participated at baseline in 2007 and 480 residents at follow-up in 2009.Methods: The intervention included educational sessions in prevention of PUs and malnutrition for registered nurses (RNs) and nursing aides (NAs) in the two intervention groups. In addition, one intervention group (intervention group 1) had a CDSS integrated into the electronic healthcare record (EHR) based on two research-based risk assessment instruments: the Risk Assessment Pressure Scale (RAPS) for PU risk screening and the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA (R)) scale for screening nutritional status. In each participating nursing home trained RNs and NAs examined all residents who consented to participate on the RAPS and the MNA (R) scale. This examination included a skin assessment and details about PUs were collected.Results: The proportion of malnourished residents decreased significantly in intervention group 1 between the two data collection periods (2007 and 2009). No other significant effects of the CDSS on resident outcomes based on the RAPS and MNA (R) scores were found.Conclusion: CDSSs used by RNs and NAs in nursing homes are still largely unexplored. A CDSS can be incorporated into the EHR to increase the meaningful use of these computerized systems in nursing home care. The effects of CDSS on healthcare provider workflow, clinical decision making and communication about preventive measures in nursing home practice still need further exploration.

However, most studies have emphasized the accuracy of the computer system alone, without placing clinicians in the role of direct users.Objective To explore the extent to which consultations with DSSs improve clinicians' diagnostic hypotheses in a set of diagnostically challenging cases.Design Partially randomized controlled trial conducted in a laboratory setting, using a prospective balanced experimental design in 1995-1998,Setting Three academic medical centers, none of which were involved in the development of the DSSs,Participants A total of 216 physicians: 72 at each site, including 24 internal medicine faculty members, 24 senior residents, and 24 fourth-year medical students. One physician's data were lost to analysis.Intervention Two DSSs, ILIAD (version 4.2) and Quick Medical Reference (QMR; version 3.7.1), were used by participants for diagnostic evaluation of a total of 36 cases based on actual patients. After training, each subject evaluated 9 of the 36 cases, first without and then using a DSS, and suggested an ordered list of diagnostic hypotheses after each evaluation.Main Outcome Measure Diagnostic accuracy, measured as the presence of the correct diagnosis on the hypothesis list and also using a derived diagnostic quality score, before and after consultation with the DSSs.Results Correct diagnoses appeared in subjects' hypothesis lists for 39.5% of cases prior to consultation and 45.4% of cases after consultation. Subjects' mean diagnostic quality scores increased from 5.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5-5.9) to 6.1 (95% CI, 5.9-6.3) (effect size: Cohen d = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.23-0.41; P<.001).

We aimed to assess whether a teaching intervention enabled residents to effectively challenge clearly wrong clinical decisions made by their staff.Subjects and Intervention: Following ethics board approval, second year residents were randomized to a teaching intervention targeting cognitive skills needed to challenge a superior's decision, or a control group receiving general crisis management instruction. Two weeks later, subjects participated in a simulated crisis that presented them with opportunities to challenge clearly wrong decisions in a can't-intubate-can't-ventilate scenario. It was only disclosed that the staff was a confederate during the debriefing. Performances were video recorded and assessed by two raters blinded to group allocation using the modified Advocacy-Inquiry Score.Measurements and Main Results: Fifty residents completed the study. The interrater reliability of the modified Advocacy-Inquiry Scores (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.87) was excellent. The median (interquartile range) best modified AdvocacyInquiry Score was significantly better in the intervention group 5.0 (4.50-5.62 [4-6]) than in the control group 3.5 (3.0-4.75 [3-6]) (p < 0.001).Conclusions: A short targeted teaching intervention was effective in significantly improving residents' ability to challenge a wrong decision by a superior.

Tested factors were attitudinal - trust and confidence, non-attitudinal - decision support experience and clinical experience, and environmental - task difficulty. The paradigm of simulated decision support advice within a prescribing context was used.Design: The study employed within participant before-after design, whereby 26 UK NHS General Practitioners were shown 20 hypothetical prescribing scenarios with prevalidated correct and incorrect answers - advice was incorrect in 6 scenarios. They were asked to prescribe for each case, followed by being shown simulated advice. Participants were then asked whether they wished to change their prescription, and the post-advice prescription was recorded.Measurements: Rate of overall decision switching was captured. Automation bias was measured by negative consultations - correct to incorrect prescription switching.Results: Participants changed prescriptions in 22.5% of scenarios. The pre-advice accuracy rate of the clinicians was 50.38%, which improved to 58.27% post-advice. The CDSS improved the decision accuracy in 13.1% of prescribing cases. The rate of automation bias, as measured by decision switches from correct pre-advice, to incorrect post-advice was 5.2% of all cases - a net improvement of 8%.More immediate factors such as trust in the specific CDSS, decision confidence, and task difficulty influenced rate of decision switching. Lower clinical experience was associated with more decision switching.Age, DSS experience and trust in CDSS generally were not significantly associated with decision switching.Conclusions: This study adds to the literature surrounding automation bias in terms of its potential frequency and influencing factors.

However, research examining differences in ethical decision making across fields and levels of experience is limited. In the present study, biases that undermine ethical decision making and compensatory strategies that may aid ethical decision making were identified in a series of interviews with 63 faculty members across six academic fields (e.g. biological sciences, health sciences, social sciences) and three levels of rank (assistant professor, associate professor, and full professor) as well as across gender. The degree to which certain biases and compensatory strategies were used in justifications for responses to ethical situations was compared across fields, level of experience, and gender. Major differences were found across fields for several biases and compensatory strategies, including biases and compensatory strategies related to use of professional field principles and field-specific guidelines. Furthermore, full professors tend to differ greatly from assistant and associate professors on a number of constructs, and there were differences in the consistency with which biases and compensatory strategies were displayed within these various groups.

9,921,4,"AIM: Following the introduction of thromboprophylaxis risk assessment tools at Southampton University Hospitals Trust in April 2008, this audit aimed to assess the level of understanding for correct thromboprophylaxis use for patients among hospital staff within the trust.METHODOLOGY: 50 members of staff, including doctors, nurses and pharmacists, chosen at random, were surveyed using a questionnaire. They were asked whether they thought venous thromboembolism was a problem among hospital patients; their awareness of the current prevention tools in the trust; whether they complete the assessment labels in patients' admission notes; and whether they have seen incorrect use of thromboprophylaxis and had they taken appropriate action to correct the errors.OUTCOMES/RESULTS: The authors found that while the general level of awareness for thromboprophylaxis is good within the organization, compliance with the Trust guidelines was inadequate at 32%, resulting in high levels of inappropriate thromboprophylaxis use which is poorly recognized by staff. In particular, there is a lack of participation from nursing staff owing to a lack of motivation and confidence. Only half of the doctors surveyed completed thromboprophylaxis assessment labels on patients' admission notes; all were junior doctors. Pharmacists were generally better at recognizing and correcting errors in thromboprophylaxis prescription compared with doctors.CONCLUSIONS: It is clear from this audit that staff knowledge and attitudes to thromboprophylaxis must be improved further by reinforcing educational programmes for both medical and non-medical health professionals.

9,923,review,"Background: Medical students may not be able to identify the essential elements of situational awareness (SA) necessary for clinical reasoning. Recent studies suggest that students have little insight into cognitive processing and SA in clinical scenarios. Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) could be used to assess certain elements of situational awareness. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature with a view to identifying whether levels of SA based on Endsley's model can be assessed utilising OSCEs during undergraduate medical training.Methods: A systematic search was performed pertaining to SA and OSCEs, to identify studies published between January 1975 (first paper describing an OSCE) and February 2017, in peer reviewed international journals published in English. PUBMED, EMBASE, PsycINFO Ovid and SCOPUS were searched for papers that described the assessment of SA using OSCEs among undergraduate medical students. Key search terms included ""objective structured clinical examination"", ""objective structured clinical assessment"" or ""OSCE"" and ""non-technical skills"", ""sense-making"", ""clinical reasoning"", ""perception"", ""comprehension"", ""projection"", ""situation awareness"", ""situational awareness"" and ""situation assessment"". Boolean operators (AND, OR) were used as conjunctions to narrow the search strategy, resulting in the limitation of papers relevant to the research interest. Areas of interest were elements of SA that can be assessed by these examinations.Results: The initial search of the literature retrieved 1127 publications. Upon removal of duplicates and papers relating to nursing, paramedical disciplines, pharmacy and veterinary education by title, abstract or full text, 11 articles were eligible for inclusion as related to the assessment of elements of SA in undergraduate medical students.Discussion: Review of the literature suggests that whole-task OSCEs enable the evaluation of SA associated with clinical reasoning skills. If they address the levels of SA, these OSCEs can provide supportive feedback and strengthen educational measures associated with higher diagnostic accuracy and reasoning abilities.Conclusion: Based on the findings, the early exposure of medical students to SA is recommended, utilising OSCEs to evaluate and facilitate SA in dynamic environments.",Fischer,2017,Situational awareness within objective structured clinical examination stations in undergraduate medical training - a literature search,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,17,,,Web of Science,"Fischer, Markus A.; Kennedy, Kieran M.; Durning, Steven; Schijven, Marlies P.; Ker, Jean; O'Connor, Paul; Doherty, Eva; Kropmans, Thomas J.

9,927,4,"To clarify how psychologists make judgments, 3 studies were conducted. The results from 2 studies indicate that the representativeness heuristic (D. Kahneman &amp; A. Tversky, 1973) describes how diagnoses are made. That is, clinicians seem to make diagnoses by comparing patients to typical patients (e.g., the typical patient with schizophrenia). In a 3rd study, the representativeness heuristic did not describe how clinicians make behavioral predictions. Instead, the past-behavior heuristic was descriptive. The results can help psychologists understand why different problems occur in psychodiagnosis. For example, the results suggest that when race bias and gender bias occur in psychodiagnosis, they occur because race or gender are features of a clinician's stereotypes, not because clinicians are attending to base rates.

Mathematical representations of such clinical judges can often be constructed to capture critical aspects of their judgmental strategies. An analysis of the characteristics of such models permits a specification of the conditions under which the model itself will be a more valid predictor than will the man from whom it was derived.

Through repeated observations, 354 instances were identified in 124 of these games. When an away player launches an ABS, the home crowd is likely to recite in unison an “Air ball, air ball” chant (ABC) to single the shooter out to supposedly generate an ego threat and to impede his future performance. We studied multiple player factors such as status (i.e., being a game starter or not), success on the previous shooting attempt, ABS distance, and ABS outcome, as well as crowd density, and found that home crowds were more likely to initially chant when the shot was made from a distance and when it resulted in a lost possession. Home crowds were also more persistent in their ABC when the shot was made farther from the basket. The findings are discussed in the context of early and current crowd behavior theories.

9,933,4,"Managers sometimes sacrifice profits only to improve their relative competitive standing, a behaviour that is known as ""competitive irrationality."" Previous research has generated a wealth of insight into the general foundations of this often dysfunctional type of managerial decision-making. However, almost no attention has been devoted to the question of how managers can reduce competitive irrationality. We address this issue by adopting the logic of debiasing research to hypothesize about five potential counter-measures: creating accountability, ""considering the opposite,"" making the bias of competitive irrationality salient to the decision maker, reducing time pressure and relying on external advice. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 934 managers using web-based experiments. Our empirical evidence supports our call for reducing time pressure in managerial decision-making and for providing managers with training in biases to attenuate competitive irrationality. However, our data also indicate that efforts to make managers feel accountable for their actions can have a detrimental effect on decision quality, which is contrary to our theorizing.

9,934,9,"OBJECTIVE: In the era of evidence-based medicine, understanding study design and levels of evidence (LoE) criteria is an important component of resident education and aids practicing surgeons in making informed clinical decisions. The purpose of this study is to analyze the ability of orthopedic residents to accurately determine LoE criteria for published articles compared with medical students.DESIGN: Basic science article.SETTING: Geisinger Medical Center (Danville, PA), tertiary referral center.PARTICIPANTS: Overall, 25 U.S. orthopedic residents and 15 4th year medical students interviewing for a residency position in orthopedic surgery voluntarily participated and provided baseline demographic information. A total of 15 articles from the American Volume of Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery were identified. Study participants were provided with the article tide, the abstract, and the complete methods section. The assigned LoE designation was with-held and access to the LoE criteria used by Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery was provided. Each participant was assigned a study type and LoE designation for each article.RESULTS: There were more correct responses regarding the article type (67%) than for LoE designation (39%). For LoE, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.30. The percentage of correct responses for article type and LoE increased with more years of training (p = 0.005 and p = 0.002). Although residents had a higher proportion of correct LoE responses overall than medical students, this difference did not reach statistical significance (42% vs. 35%, p = 0.07).CONCLUSIONS: Although improvements in accurately determining both article type and LoE were seen among residents with increasing years of training, residents were unable to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement for determining LoE or article type when compared with medical students. Strategies to improve resident understanding of LoE guidelines need to be incorporated into orthopedic residencies, especially when considering the increased emphasis on evidence-based medicine.

9,935,9,"This paper examines beliefs held by Swedish legal professionals about eyewitness testimony. In a survey including questions about 13 key issues of eyewitness testimony, three groups were investigated: police officers (n =104), prosecutors (n = 158), and judges (n = 251). The response rate was 74%. Examples of findings are that the beliefs were in line with scientific findings concerning the weapon focus effect, but were not in line for simultaneous vs. sequential lineups. Between-group differences were found for seven items. Judges were much more sceptical than police officers about the reliability and completeness of children's testimonies. The groups seldom agreed about one answer alternative, and they reported not being up to date about scientific research on eyewitness testimony. The results suggest that some important research findings have reached those working on the field. However, they hold many wrongful beliefs about eyewitness testimony, beliefs that might compromise the accuracy of legal decisions.

9,936,4,"Context: Studies documenting racial/ethnic disparities in health care frequently implicate physicians’ unconscious biases. No study to date has measured physicians’ unconscious racial bias to test whether this predicts physicians’ clinical decisions. Objective: To test whether physicians show implicit race bias and whether the magnitude of such bias predicts thrombolysis recommendations for black and white patients with acute coronary syndromes. Design, Setting and Participants: An internet-based tool comprising a clinical vignette of a patient presenting to the emergency department with an acute coronary syndrome, followed by a questionnaire and three Implicit Association Tests (IATs). Study invitations were e-mailed to all internal medicine and emergency medicine residents at four academic medical centers in Atlanta and Boston; 287 completed the study, met inclusion criteria, and were randomized to either a black or white vignette patient. Main Outcome Measures: IAT scores (normal continuous variable) measuring physicians’ implicit race preference and perceptions of cooperativeness. Physicians’ attribution of symptoms to coronary artery disease for vignette patients with randomly assigned race, and their decisions about thrombolysis. Assessment of physicians’ explicit racial biases by questionnaire. Results: Physicians reported no explicit preference for white versus black patients or differences in perceived cooperativeness. In contrast, IATs revealed implicit preference favoring white Americans (mean IAT score = 0.36, P &lt; .001, one-sample t test) and implicit stereotypes of black Americans as less cooperative with medical procedures (mean IAT score 0.22, P &lt; .001), and less cooperative generally (mean IAT score 0.30, P &lt; .001). As physicians’ prowhite implicit bias increased, so did their likelihood of treating white patients and not treating black patients with thrombolysis ( P = .009). Conclusions: This study represents the first evidence of unconscious (implicit) race bias among physicians, its dissociation from conscious (explicit) bias, and its predictive validity. Results suggest that physicians’ unconscious biases may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in use of medical procedures such as thrombolysis for myocardial infarction.

9,942,9,"Background: Both the Institute of Medicine and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggest patient safety can be enhanced by implementing aviation Crew Resource Management (CRM) in health care. CRM emphasizes six key areas: managing fatigue, creating and managing teams, recognizing adverse situations (red flags), cross-checking and communication, decision making, and performance feedback. This study evaluates participant reactions and attitudes to CRM training. Study Design: From April 22, 2003, to December 11, 2003, clinical teams from the trauma unit, emergency department, operative services, cardiac catheterization laboratory, and administration underwent an 8-hour training course. Participants completed an 11-question End-of-Course Critique (ECC), designed to assess the perceived need for training and usefulness of CRM skill sets. The Human Factors Attitude Survey contains 23 items and is administered on the same day both pre- and posttraining. It measures attitudinal shifts toward the six training modules and CRM. Results: Of the 489 participants undergoing CRM training during the study period, 463 (95%) completed the ECC and 338 (69%) completed the Human Factors Attitude Survey. The demographics of the group included 288 (59%) nurses and technicians, 104 (21%) physicians, and 97 (20%) administrative personnel. Responses to the ECC were very positive for all questions, and 95% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed CRM training would reduce errors in their practice. Responses to the Human Factors Attitude Survey indicated that the training had a positive impact on 20 of the 23 items (p ≤ 0.01). Conclusions: CRM training improves attitudes toward fatigue management, team building, communication, recognizing adverse events, team decision making, and performance feedback. Participants agreed that CRM training will reduce errors and improve patient safety.

9,945,9,"Purpose Many educational programs seek to develop skills in evidence-based medicine (EBM). The authors examined the efficacy of teaching the EBM skill of efficiently searching the research literature. They compared students who received brief training in EBM searching skills with those who did not, and assessed the quality of literature searching one month after that training.Method The authors used a nonrandomized control group study design to quantify the impact of a single, brief (two-hour) instructional intervention on EBM-based techniques for searching Medline for evidence related to a clinical problem provided to the students. Ninety-two fourth-year medical students (34 intervention, 58 control) at the University of Michigan participated in a four-week EBM elective between 2001 and 2003. The authors conducted a preintervention assessment of searching skills, followed by a repeat assessment one month after the intervention. Search quality was judged by medical librarians using a structured clinical scenario and scoring algorithm.Results Data for 30 intervention and 40 control students could be analyzed. Intervention students had fewer search errors and correspondingly higher quality searches than did control students. The educational intervention accounted for approximately 8% of the variance in both of these outcomes. The most common search errors were a lack of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) explosion, missing MeSH terms, lack of appropriate limits, failure to search for best evidence, and inappropriate combination of all search concepts.Conclusions This study provides evidence that a single, brief training session can have a marked beneficial effect on the quality of subsequent, short-term EBM literature searching performance outcomes.",Gruppen,2005,A controlled comparison study of the efficacy of training medical students in evidence-based medicine literature searching skills,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,80,940,944,Web of Science,"Gruppen, LD; Rana, GK; Arndt, TS"
9,946,4,"Purpose: To evaluate the effect of patients' clinical information on experts' diagnoses of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and decisions to treat.Methods: Seven experts assessed wide-field fundus photographs of eyes of 52 premature infants of <= 30 weeks' gestational age or <= 1,500 g birthweight (BW) for ROP diagnosis (stage, plus disease, and aggressive posterior ROP) and the necessity for treatment for 2 days. On Day 1, they were masked to all patient data. On Day 2, they were given information on gestational age and BW.Results: A significant shift in the experts' ratings toward a less aggressive ROP grading stage (P = 0.006) and less frequent decision for intervention (P = 0.021) was observed after receipt of patients' clinical information. This was truer for heavier/less premature infants (gestational age >= 28 0/7 weeks or BW >= 900 g) than those with very low BWs/high prematurity (gestational age < 24 0/7 weeks or BW < 600 g) (ROP stage P = 0.009 vs. P = 0.399, treatment decision P = 0.022 vs. P = 0.648).Conclusion: These results suggest knowledge of patients' clinical information influences the grading of ROP disease and decision for treatment.

Such observations led to the development of an anatomy recognition training intervention, specifically the use of an ordered set of video clips that show the main steps of a laparoscopic procedure. Each procedural step is shown several times in succession, with each repetition coming from a different surgery, thus exposing the learner to varied anatomy and crucial maneuvers. A factorial experiment with 30 medical students showed that the group using these ordered, perceptual learning modules had a significant increase in scores on questions assessing perceptual knowledge and procedural knowledge, with no corresponding increase for the control group who watched the videos from the same cases but in an unstructured format for the same amount of time (p < 0.05).

9,952,4,"Introduction Patient-physician racial discordance is associated with Black patient reports of dissatisfaction and mistrust, which in turn are associated with poor adherence to treatment recommendations and underutilisation of healthcare. Research further has shown that patient dissatisfaction and mistrust are magnified particularly when physicians hold high levels of implicit racial bias. This suggests that physician implicit racial bias manifests in their communication behaviours during medical interactions. The overall goal of this research is to identify physician communication behaviours that link physician implicit racial bias and Black patient immediate (patient-reported satisfaction and trust) and long-term outcomes (eg, medication adherence, self-management and healthcare utilisation) as well as clinical indicators of diabetes control (eg, blood pressure, HbA1c and history of diabetes complication).Methods and analysis Using an exploratory sequential mixed methods research design, we will collect data from approximately 30 family medicine physicians and 300 Black patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The data sources will include one physician survey, three patient surveys, medical interaction videos, video elicitation interviews and medical chart reviews. Physician implicit racial bias will be assessed with the physician survey, and patient outcomes will be assessed with the patient surveys and medical chart reviews. In video elicitation interviews, a subset of patients (approximately 20-40) will watch their own interactions while being monitored physiologically to identify evocative physician behaviours. Information from the interview will determine which physician communication behaviours will be coded from medical interactions videos. Coding will be done independently by two trained coders. A series of statistical analyses (zeroorder correlations, partial correlations, regressions) will be conducted to identify physician behaviours that are associated significantly with both physician implicit racial bias and patient outcomes.Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the Virginia Commonwealth University IRB. Study results will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences.

9,953,4,"Context: Studies involving physicians suggest that unconscious bias may be related to clinical decision making and may predict poor patient-physician interaction. The presence of unconscious race and social class bias and its association with clinical assessments or decision making among medical students is unknown. Objective: To estimate unconscious race and social class bias among first-year medical students and investigate its relationship with assessments made during clinical vignettes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A secure Web-based survey was administered to 211 medical students entering classes at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, in August 2009 and August 2010. The survey included the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to assess unconscious preferences, direct questions regarding students’ explicit race and social class preferences, and 8 clinical assessment vignettes focused on pain assessment, informed consent, patient reliability, and patient trust. Adjusting for student demographics, multiple logistic regression was used to determine whether responses to the vignettes were associated with unconscious race or social class preferences. Main Outcome Measures: Association of scores on an established IAT for race and a novel IAT for social class with vignette responses. Results: Among the 202 students who completed the survey, IAT responses were consistent with an implicit preference toward white persons among 140 students (69%, 95% CI, 61%-75%). Responses were consistent with a preference toward those in the upper class among 174 students (86%, 95% CI, 80%-90%). Assessments generally did not vary by patient race or occupation, and multivariable analyses for all vignettes found no significant relationship between implicit biases and clinical assessments. Regression coefficient for the association between pain assessment and race IAT scores was −0.49 (95% CI, −1.00 to 0.03) and for social class, the coefficient was −0.04 (95% CI, −0.50 to 0.41). Adjusted odds ratios for other vignettes ranged from 0.69 to 3.03 per unit change in IAT score, but none were statistically significant. Analysis stratified by vignette patient race or class status yielded similarly negative results. Tests for interactions between patient race or class status and student IAT D scores in predicting clinical assessments were not statistically significant. Conclusions: The majority of first-year medical students at a single school had IAT scores consistent with implicit preference for white persons and possibly for those in the upper class. However, overall vignette-based clinical assessments were not associated with patient race or occupation, and no association existed between implicit preferences and the assessments.

9,955,4,"Background: Variation in the intensity of acute care treatment at the end of life is influenced more strongly by hospital and provider characteristics than patient preferences. Objective: We sought to describe physicians’ mental models (i.e., thought processes) when encountering a simulated critically and terminally ill older patient, and to compare those models based on whether their treatment plan was patient preference-concordant or preference-discordant. Methods: Seventy-three hospital-based physicians from 3 academic medical centers engaged in a simulated patient encounter and completed a mental model interview while watching the video recording of their encounter. We used an “expert” model to code the interviews. We then used Kruskal–Wallis tests to compare the weighted mental model themes of physicians who provided preference-concordant treatment with those who provided preference-discordant treatment. Results: Sixty-six (90%) physicians provided preference-concordant treatment and 7 (10%) provided preference-discordant treatment (i.e., they intubated the patient). Physicians who intubated the patient were more likely to emphasize the reversible and emergent nature of the patient situation (z = −2.111, P = 0.035), their own comfort (z = −2.764, P = 0.006), and rarely focused on explicit patient preferences (z = 2.380, P = 0.017). Limitations: Post-decisional interviewing with audio/video prompting may induce hindsight bias. The expert model has not yet been validated and may not be exhaustive. The small sample size limits generalizability and power. Conclusions: Hospital-based physicians providing preference-discordant used a different mental model for decision making for a critically and terminally ill simulated case. These differences may offer targets for future interventions to promote preference-concordant care for seriously ill patients.

9,957,9,"This randomized controlled trial involved the development and evaluation of a supervisor support training intervention in the civilian workforce called VSST: Veteran-Supportive Supervisor Training. A theoretically based intervention in the workplace is critical to ensuring a smooth transition for service members and their families to civilian life, leading to improved psychological and physical health and improved work outcomes among service members. Thirty-five organizations were recruited and randomized to the VSST training program or a waitlist control group. Within those organizations, 497 current or former (post 9/11) service member employees were asked to complete baseline and 3- and 9-month follow-up surveys covering work, family, and health domains. The computerized 1-hr training, and the behavior tracking that followed were completed by 928 supervisors from the participating organizations. Intervention training effects were evaluated using an intent-to-treat approach, comparing outcomes for service members who were in organizations assigned to the training group versus those who were in organizations assigned to the control group. Moderation effects revealed the intervention was effective for employees who reported higher levels of supervisor and coworker support at baseline, demonstrating the importance of the organizational context and trainee readiness. The results did not show evidence of direct effects of the intervention on health and work outcomes. Qualitative data from supervisors who took the training also demonstrated the benefits of the training. This study affirms and adds to the literature on the positive effects of organizational programs that train supervisors to provide social support, thereby improving health and work outcomes of employees who receive more support.

9,958,4,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure is not a clear-cut diagnosis but a complex clinical syndrome with consequent diagnostic uncertainty. Judgment analysis is a method to help clinical teams to understand how they make complex decisions. The method of judgment analysis was used to determine the factors that influence clinicians' diagnostic decisions about heart failure.METHODS: Three consultants, three middle grade doctors, and two junior doctors each evaluated 45 patient scenarios. The main outcomes were: clinicians' decisions whether or not to make a diagnosis of suspected heart failure; the relative importance of key factors within and between clinician groups in making these decisions, and the acceptability of the scenarios.RESULTS: The method was able to discriminate between important and unimportant factors in clinicians' diagnostic decisions. Junior and consultant physicians tended to use patient information similarly, although junior doctors placed particular weight on the chest X-Ray. Middle-grade doctors tended to use information differently but their diagnostic decisions agreed with consultants more frequently (k = 0.47) than junior doctors and consultants (k = 0.23), or middle grade and junior grade doctors (k = 0.10).CONCLUSIONS: Judgment analysis is a potentially valuable method to assess influences upon diagnostic decisions, helping clinicians to manage the quality assurance process through evaluation of care and continuing professional development.",Hancock,2012,Using the method of judgement analysis to address variations in diagnostic decision making.,BMC research notes,5,139,139,Web of Science,"Hancock, Helen C; Mason, James M; Murphy, Jerry J"

Recent work has shown that residents and anesthesiologists do not apply these guidelines when tested. This research hypothesized that a decision support tool would improve adherence to this consensus guideline.Methods: Anesthesiology residents at four training programs participated in an unblinded, prospective, randomized, -cross-over trial in which they completed two tests covering clinical scenarios. One quiz was completed from memory and one with the aid of an electronic decision support tool. Performance was evaluated by overall score (% correct), number of incorrect answers with possibly increased cost or risk of care, and the amount of time required to complete the quizzes both with and without the cognitive aid. The primary outcome was the proportion of correct responses attributable to the use of the decision support tool.Results: All anesthesiology residents at four institutions were recruited and 111 residents participated. Use of the decision support tool resulted in a 25% improvement in adherence to guidelines compared with memory alone (P < 0.0001), and participants made 77% fewer incorrect responses that would have resulted in increased costs. Use of the tool was associated with a 3.4-min increase in time to complete the test (P < 0.001).Conclusions: Use of an electronic decision support tool significantly improved adherence to the guidelines as compared with memory alone.

Performance information is used as a basis for multiple organizational decisions and as such, it is critical to understand how alternative age constructs influence these important work outcomes. Although much research has been conducted using chronological age, emerging age constructs such as successful aging at work have not been examined in relation to such decisions. Using three samples and 2 x 3 x 2 within subjects experimental vignette methodology, the present study examined the influence of successful aging at work (i.e., successful and not successful), the age-type of the job (i.e., whether the job is typically or stereotypically perceived to be an ""older,"" ""younger,"" or ""age-neutral"" type of job) and age related task-based performance patterns (i.e., pattern of behavior reflecting a stereotypically old or young employee) on ratings of performance-based outcomes (i.e., a composite of performance ratings, promotional and layoff decisions, recommendations for upgrade training, and organizational resource investments). Results showed that when decision makers perceived an employee as successfully aging at work, more positive ratings were given than when an employee was viewed as unsuccessfully aging at work. The age-type of the job and task performance patterns both interacted with successful aging at work to influence overall performance ratings and other performance related decisions.

9,961,4,"Background Although disease-specific exercise guidelines for cardiovascular disease (CVD) are widely available, it remains uncertain whether these different exercise guidelines are integrated properly for patients with different CVDs. The aim of this study was to assess the inter-clinician variance in exercise prescription for patients with various CVDs and to compare these prescriptions with recommendations from the EXercise Prescription in Everyday practice and Rehabilitative Training (EXPERT) tool, a digital decision support system for integrated state-of-the-art exercise prescription in CVD.Design The study was a prospective observational survey.Methods Fifty-three CV rehabilitation clinicians from nine European countries were asked to prescribe exercise intensity (based on percentage of peak heart rate (HRpeak)), frequency, session duration, programme duration and exercise type (endurance or strength training) for the same five patients. Exercise prescriptions were compared between clinicians, and relationships with clinician characteristics were studied. In addition, these exercise prescriptions were compared with recommendations from the EXPERT tool.Results A large inter-clinician variance was found for prescribed exercise intensity (median (interquartile range (IQR)): 83 (13) % of HRpeak), frequency (median (IQR): 4 (2) days/week), session duration (median (IQR): 45 (18) min/session), programme duration (median (IQR): 12 (18) weeks), total exercise volume (median (IQR): 1215 (1961) peak-effort training hours) and prescription of strength training exercises (prescribed in 78% of all cases). Moreover, clinicians' exercise prescriptions were significantly different from those of the EXPERT tool (p<0.001).Conclusions This study reveals significant inter-clinician variance in exercise prescription for patients with different CVDs and disagreement with an integrated state-of-the-art system for exercise prescription, justifying the need for standardization efforts regarding integrated exercise prescription in CV rehabilitation.",Hansen,2018,Do clinicians prescribe exercise similarly in patients with different cardiovascular diseases?

9,962,1,"Background: Anaesthesiologists may occasionally manage life-threatening operating room (OR) emergencies. Managing OR emergencies implies real-time analysis of often complicated situations, prompt medical knowledge retrieval, coordinated teamwork and effective decision making in stressful settings. Checklists are recommended to improve performance and reduce the risk of medical errors. This study aimed to assess the usefulness of the French Society of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care's (SFAR) ""Malignant Hyperthermia'' (MH) checklist on a simulated episode of MH crisis and management thereof by registered anesthesiologists.Methods: Twenty-four anaesthesiologists were allocated to 2 groups (checklist and control). Their technical performance in adherence with the SFAR guidelines was assessed by a 30-point score and their non-technical performance was assessed by the Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) score. Every task completion was assessed independently. Data are shown as median (first-third quartiles).Results: Anaesthesiologists in the checklist group had higher technical performance scores (24/30 (21.525) vs 18/30 (15.5-19.5), P = 0.002) and ANTS scores (56.5/60 (47.5-58) vs 48.5/60 (41-50.5), P = 0.024). They administered the complete initial dose of dantrolene (2 mg/kg) more quickly (15.7 minutes [13.918.3] vs 22.4 minutes [18.6-25]) than the control group (P = 0.017). However, anaesthesiologists deemed the usability of the checklist to be perfectible.Conclusion: Registered anaesthesiologists' use of the MH checklist during a simulation session widely improved their adherence to guidelines and non-technical skills. This study strongly suggests the benefit of checklist tools for emergency management. Notwithstanding, better awareness and training for anaesthesiologists could further improve the use of this tool.

While the set-up for ADR monitoring catches product problems, it may also be a good system to detect if such a product was not being properly used. Medication error is one such problem. Medication errors can happen unintentionally. Some of the causes of medication errors are: errors originating from the drug industry, errors arising from pharmacists' dispensing, and errors arising from nurses' administration of drugs. Health professionals should be vigilant in finding ways to prevent these errors. One way is to strengthen education and surveillance systems within the ADR reporting context. The role of pharmacovigilance centers can be expanded to address problems that occur in the clinical setting.

9,966,4,"Workers' attentional failures or inattention toward detecting a hazard can lead to inappropriate decisions and unsafe behaviors. Previous research has shown that individual characteristics such as past injury exposure contribute greatly to skill-based (e.g., attention failure) and perception-based (e.g., failure to identify and misperception) errors and subsequent accident involvement. However, a dearth of research empirically examined how a worker's personality affects his or her attention and hazard identification. This study addresses this knowledge gap by exploring the impacts of the personality dimensions on the selective attention of workers exposed to fall hazards. To this end, construction workers were recruited to engage in a laboratory eye-tracking experiment that consisted of 115 potential and active fall scenarios in 35 construction images captured from actual projects within the United States. Construction workers' personalities were assessed through the self-completion of the Big Five personality questionnaire, and their visual attention was monitored continuously using a wearable eye-tracking apparatus. The results of the study show that workers' personality dimensions-specifically, extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness to experience-significantly relate to and impact attentional allocations and the search strategies of workers exposed to fall hazards. A more detailed investigation of this connection showed that individuals who are introverted, more conscientious, or more open to experience are less prone to injury and return their attention more frequently to hazardous areas. This study is the first attempt to illustrate how examining relationships among personality, attention, and hazard identification can reveal opportunities for the early detection of at-risk workers who are more likely to be involved in accidents. A better understanding of these connections provides valuable insight into both practice and theory regarding the transformation of current training and educational practices by providing appropriate intervention strategies for personalized safety guidelines and effective training materials to transform personality-driven at-risk workers into safer workers.",Hasanzadeh,2019,"Role of Personality in Construction Safety: Investigating the Relationships between Personality, Attentional Failure, and Hazard Identification under Fall-Hazard Conditions",JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT,145,,,Web of Science,"Hasanzadeh, Sogand; Dao, Bac; Esmaeili, Behzad; Dodd, Michael D."
9,967,9,"Background: Managing patients with polypharmacy is a challenging issue in primary care. The aim of this study is to determine whether a patient-centered systematic review leads to more appropriate medication use in patients without negatively affecting quality of life and the course of the disease.Methods/Design : The trial is a two-armed, double blinded cluster-randomized controlled trial. Primary care physicians (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Physicians in the intervention group undergo training with instruction of the algorithm. The control group is given a lecture on multimorbidity and instructions for collecting data in a usual care manner.PCPs will approach patients aged 60 years or older who are taking 5 or more drugs. The study period is 1 year. The primary outcome measure is the change in the number of drugs 12 months after the algorithm was applied by the PCP during consultation with the patient. Secondary outcomes are: change in the number of drugs immediately after the encounter and 6 months later, reason for a change of the medication, discrepancy in the decision to change between PCP and patient, number of drugs for which the patient is suggesting a change, number of drugs the patient is taking that are not known to the PCP, time consumption of the intervention, disease-specific variables to evaluate the course of the disease(s) for which the patient is being treated, quality of life, barriers against using the algorithm, numbers of drugs readopted due to an unfavorable course of the disease, and numbers of drugs which have been started.Discussion: Answering the four questions of the algorithm requires a weighing-up of risks and benefits and contains a shared-decision-making approach: a prioritization of the treatment goals is necessary. This can only be done in collaboration with the patient. The majority of patients with multimorbidity are treated in the primary care setting.

Using rich qualitative data from a national sample of 203 law students, this study examines classroom-level diversity, consequences when it is absent, and necessary conditions for activating the educational benefits. From the students’ perspective, structural diversity in the classroom is a necessary prerequisite for more enlightening, interesting discussions, which promote better learning outcomes. However, the mere presence of diversity does not necessarily educe these benefits, the diversity must in fact be “activated” (Marin, 2000). Therefore, we find faculty members have the responsibility to create spaces for diverse viewpoints to be heard and to facilitate discussion so all students benefit. We call for training to help faculty take on these roles, along with other implications for policy and practice, concluding that U.S. law schools must do a better job incorporating racial diversity in teaching, learning, and practice, or they will have failed to address a compelling national interest.

Background: In the past few years an increasing number of people have been injured, sometimes fatally, as a result of police weapons being discharged involuntarily. Methods: Two experiments were performed using a pistol fitted with sensors to register the pressure exerted on the hand stock and the trigger. In Study 1, 34 police officers reacted to a set case using the prepared pistol. In Study 2, 25 participants performed 13 tasks requiring the use of different limbs. Results: In Study 1, about 20% of participating officers made contact with the trigger, thus violating police regulations to keep the trigger finger outside the trigger guard at all times until a conscious decision to fire has been made. Study 2 showed that motor activity in different limbs leads to a significant increase in grip force exerted on a firearm (significant results for 12 of 13 trials, Bonferroni-corrected p <.004). Furthermore, pressure on the trigger resulting from involuntary muscle contractions was, in certain cases, sufficient to unintentionally discharge a weapon.

9,975,9,"Context: The fostering of diagnostic competence is an important goal of medical education. Worked‐example cases with integrated errors represent a promising method of doing so. Objectives: This study investigates whether the provision of self‐explanation prompts and adaptable feedback fosters diagnostic competence in a computer‐supported learning environment based on worked‐example cases with integrated errors. Methods: A total of 103 medical students participated in the study. After a test of prior diagnostic competence, learners studied worked examples with integrated errors for cases of heart failure of different causes in a computer‐based learning environment. The worked examples started with the description of a clinical situation in which a student apprentice diagnoses a patient and commits errors in the conclusions he draws from the information presented. Participants were randomly assigned to four learning conditions that varied in two factors: self‐explanation prompts and adaptable feedback. In the self‐explanation prompts condition, students were prompted to reflect on the errors. Independently of the condition, the student apprentice in the worked example receives feedback on his diagnosis. In the adaptable feedback condition, students were able to adjust the level of elaboration of the feedback. A post‐test of diagnostic competence was administered. Results: Adaptable feedback had a positive effect on important aspects of diagnostic competence (strategic knowledge: F (1,93) = 4.15, p &lt; 0.05, partial η² = 0.04; decision‐oriented practical knowledge: F (1,93) = 4.41, p &lt; 0.05, partial η² = 0.05), whereas self‐explanation prompts did not further improve the effectiveness of the learning environment. Conclusions: In the use of worked examples with integrated errors, the provision of adaptable feedback whereby learners have control over the amount of feedback they receive seems to be advantageous to the development of important decision‐oriented aspects of diagnostic competence. Additional help to stimulate reflection about the error by self‐explanation prompts does not seem to be critical.

,978,2,"As Australia's population ages, there is concern that mental health professionals may not be prepared to deal with the increasing number of older people. The present study conducted a postal survey of Australian psychologists and counselors to ascertain whether older clients are less likely to be diagnosed with depression and are regarded less favorably than younger clients. Respondents received one of two versions of a vignette describing a depressed female client. The vignettes differed only in whether the fictitious client was aged 42 or aged 72. Responses were received from 414 psychologists and 293 counselors, representing a response rate of 38%. In general, response patterns did not differ between psychologists and counselors. Most respondents correctly identified depression regardless of the client's age. Attitudes toward treating the older client were consistently less favorable than for the younger client. The older client was rated as significantly less able to develop an adequate therapeutic relationship, to have a poorer prognosis, and to be less appropriate for therapy; and the therapists felt less competent in treating her and were less willing to accept her as a client. The evidence of an age bias has significant implications for the education and training of psychologists and counselors.",Helmes,2003,Attitudes of Australian therapists toward older clients: Educational and training imperatives,EDUCATIONAL GERONTOLOGY,29,657,670,Web of Science,"Helmes, E; Gee, S"
9,979,4,"Recruitment is an ongoing challenge in the health industry with general practitioner (GP) shortages in many areas beyond rural and Indigenous communities. This paper suggests a marketing solution that identifies different segments of the GP market for recruitment strategy development. In February 2008, 96 GPs in Australia responded to a mail questionnaire (of which 85 questionnaires were useable). A total of 350 GPs were sent the questionnaire. Respondents considered small sets of attributes in the decision to accept a new job at a general practice and selected the most and least important attribute from each set. We identified latent class clusters (cohorts) of GPs from the most-least important data. Three cohorts were found in the GP market, distinguishing practitioners who emphasised job, family or practice attributes in their decision to join a practice. Few significant demographic differences exist between the cohorts. Asegmented GP market suggests two alternative recruitment strategies. One option is for general practices to target members of a single cohort (family-, job-, or practice-focussed GPs). The other option is for general practices to diversify their recruitment strategies to target all three cohorts (family-, job-and practice-focussed GPs).

All residents from these centers were asked to participate and were randomized into 2 groups. Group A (n = 30) served as the control and received traditional teaching materials; group B (n = 38) received a digital video disc of the Virtual Mentor program. This program is an interactive cognitive simulation, specifically designed to separate cognitive aspects (such as decision making and error recognition) from the motor aspects. Both groups took online anonymous pretests (n = 68) and posttests (n = 58), and answered satisfaction questionnaires (n = 53). Wilcoxon tests were completed to compare pretest and posttest scores between groups. Analysis of variance was performed to assess differences in mean scores between groups.Main Outcome Measures: Scores on pretests, posttests, and satisfaction questionnaires.Results: There was no difference in the pretest scores between the 2 groups (P = 0.62). However, group B (Virtual Mentor [VM]) scored significantly higher on the posttest (P = 0.01). Mean difference between pretest and posttest scores were significantly better in the VM group than in the traditional learning group (P = 0.04). Questionnaire revealed that the VM program was ""more fun"" to use (24.1% vs 4.2%) and residents were more likely to use this type of program again compared with the likelihood of using the traditional tools (58.6% vs 4.2%).Conclusions: The VM, a cognitive computer simulation, augmented teaching of the hydrodissection step of phacoemulsification surgery compared with traditional teaching alone.

9,983,9,"16 therapists participated in a year-long manualized training program as part of the Vanderbilt II study of time-limited dynamic psychotherapy. Changes in therapist behavior were measured with the Vanderbilt Therapeutic Strategies Scale (an adherence measure), the Vanderbilt Psychotherapy Process Scale (VPPS), and interpersonal process codings using the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB). The training program successfully changed therapists' technical interventions in line with the manualized protocol. After training, there was increased emphasis on the expression of in-session affect, exploration of the therapeutic relationship, an improved participant–observer stance, and greater use of open-ended questions. There was also an indication of unexpected deterioration in certain interpersonal and interactional aspects of therapy as measured by the VPPS and SASB ratings. These results question the assumption that greater control of the therapy variable is straightforwardly achieved with manuals and adherence scales.

,984,1,"Decision-making accuracy and the time cost of incorrect responses was compared between higher- (n = 14) and lower-standard (n = 14) Australian footballers during reactive agility tasks incorporating feint and nonfeint scenarios. Accuracy was assessed as whether the subject turned in the correct direction to each stimulus. With skill groups pooled, decision accuracy at the first (or only) stimulus (decision time 1) was 94 +/- 7%, and it decreased to 83 +/- 20% for the second stimulus (decision time 2; p = 0.01; d = 0.69). However, with skill groups separated, decision accuracy was similar between groups at decision time 1 (higher 95 +/- 6% vs. lower 92 +/- 7%; p = 0.6; d = 0.42), somewhat better in the higher-standard group at decision time 2 (88 +/- 22% vs. 78 +/- 17%; p = 0.08; d = 0.50). But the decrease in accuracy from decision time 1 to 2 was significant in the lower-standard group only (92 +/- 7% to 78 +/- 17%; p = 0.02; d = 1.04). However, with skill groups pooled but agility times examined exclusively in trials involving correct or incorrect decisions, incorrect decisions at decision time 1 during feint trials resulted in a shorter agility time (1.73 +/- 0.24 seconds vs. 2.03 +/- 0.39 seconds; p = 0.008; d = 0.92), whereas agility time was significantly longer in feint (incorrect at decision time 2 only; 2.65 +/- 0.41 seconds vs. 1.97 +/- 0.36 seconds; p < 0.001; d = 1.76) and nonfeint trials (1.64 +/- 0.13 seconds vs. 1.51 +/- 0.10 seconds; p = 0.001; d = 1.13). Therefore, although decision-making errors typically worsen reactive agility performance, successful anticipation of a feint can produce performance improvements. Furthermore, higher-standard footballers are less susceptible to such feints, perhaps because of superior anticipation.

Because of the high stakes, practitioners, legal decision makers, and policy makers should have some idea of the magnitude and variability of error rates in this domain. A novel approach was used to estimate individual error rates for 110 professionals (psychologists, physicians, social workers, and others) who conduct or participate in forensic child sexual abuse evaluations. The median estimated false positive and false negative error rates were 0.18 and 0.36, respectively. Estimated error rates varied markedly from one participant to the next. For example, the false positive error rate estimates ranged from 0.00 to 0.83.

Participants were given literature-derived preexamination probabilities for each condition and were asked to (1) estimate postexamination probabilities (post-EPs) and (2) select a diagnostic choice (report that condition is present, order more tests, or report that condition is absent). Participants' inverse transformed logit (ITL) mean post-EPs were compared with corresponding literature-derived post-EPs.ResultsOf 906 individuals invited to participate, 684 (75%) submitted a completed survey. In two of four scenarios with positive findings, the participants' ITL mean post-EPs were significantly less than corresponding literature-derived post-EP point estimates (P < .001 for each). In three of four scenarios with negative findings, ITL mean post-EPs were significantly greater than corresponding literature-derived post-EP point estimates (P < .001 for each).

The majority of these diagnoses, but not all, will be correct. This study determined whether further reflection regarding initial diagnoses improves diagnostic accuracy during a high-stakes board exam, a model for studying clinical decision making. Method: Keystroke response data were used from 500 residents who took the 2010 American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Internal Medicine Certification Examination. Data included time to initial response on each question, whether the answer was correct, and whether or not the resident changed her or his initial response. The focus was on 80 diagnosis questions that comprised realistic clinical vignettes with multiple-choice single-best answers. Cognitive skill (ability) was measured using overall exam scores. Case complexity was determined using item difficulty (proportion of examinees that correctly answered the question). A hierarchical generalized linear model was used to assess the relationship between time spent on initial responses and the probability of correctly answering the questions. Results: On average, residents changed their responses on 12% of all diagnosis questions (or 9.6 questions out of 80). Changing an answer from incorrect to correct was almost twice as likely as changing an answer from correct to incorrect. The relationship between response time and accuracy was complex.

9,992,4,"BackgroundThe comparison of fingerprints by expert latent print examiners generally involves repeating a process in which the examiner selects a small area of distinctive features in one print (a target group), and searches for it in the other print. In order to isolate this key element of fingerprint comparison, we use eye-tracking data to describe the behavior of latent fingerprint examiners on a narrowly defined find the target task. Participants were shown a fingerprint image with a target group indicated and asked to find the corresponding area of ridge detail in a second impression of the same finger and state when they found the target location. Target groups were presented on latent and plain exemplar fingerprint images, and as small areas cropped from the plain exemplars, to assess how image quality and the lack of surrounding visual context affected task performance and eye behavior. One hundred and seventeen participants completed a total of 675 trials.ResultsThe presence or absence of context notably affected the areas viewed and time spent in comparison; differences between latent and plain exemplar tasks were much less significant. In virtually all trials, examiners repeatedly looked back and forth between the images, suggesting constraints on the capacity of visual working memory. On most trials where context was provided, examiners looked immediately at the corresponding location: with context, median time to find the corresponding location was less than 0.3s (second fixation); however, without context, median time was 1.9s (five fixations). A few trials resulted in errors in which the examiner did not find the correct target location. Basic gaze measures of overt behaviors, such as speed, areas visited, and back-and-forth behavior, were used in conjunction with the known target area to infer the underlying cognitive state of the examiner.ConclusionsVisual context has a significant effect on the eye behavior of latent print examiners. Localization errors suggest how errors may occur in real comparisons: examiners sometimes compare an incorrect but similar target group and do not continue to search for a better candidate target group.

9,996,9,"This study explored the attitudes of biomedical science students (medical students) in a non-Western setting towards three medical ethics concepts that are based on fundamental Western culture ethical principles. A dichotomous (agree/disagree) response questionnaire was constructed using Western ethnocentric culture (WEC) based perspectives of informed consent, confidentiality, and substitute decision-making. Hypothesized WEC-Biased responses were assigned to the questionnaire's questions or propositions. A number of useful responses (169) were obtained from a large, cross-sectional, convenience sample of the MBChB students at the University of Zimbabwe Medical School. Statistical analysis described the differences in response patterns between the student's responses compared to the hypothesized WEC-Biased response. The effect of the nine independent variables on selected dependent variables (responses to certain questionnaire questions) was analyzed by stepwise logistic regression. Students concurred with the hypothesized WEC-Biased responses for two-thirds of the questionnaire items. This agreement included support for the role of legal advocacy in the substitute decision-making process. The students disagreed with the hypothesized WEC-Biased responses in several important medical ethics aspects. Most notably, the students indicated that persons with mental dysfunctions, as a class, were properly considered incompetent to make treatment decisions. None of the studied independent variables was often associated with students' responses, but training year was more frequently implicated than either ethnicity or gender. In order to develop internationally and culturally relevant medical ethics standards, non-Western perspectives ought to be acknowledged and incorporated. Two main areas for further efforts include: curriculum development in ethics reasoning and related clinical (medico-legal) decision-making processes that would be relevant to medical students from various cultures, and; the testing of models that could increase legal system input in the clinical process in societies with limited jurisprudence resources.

9,997,4,"Research generally indicates that providers demonstrate modest insight into their clinical decision processes. In a previous study utilizing virtual human (VH) technology, we found that patient demographic characteristics and facial expressions of pain were statistically significant predictors of many nurses' pain-related decisions. The current study examined the correspondence between the statistically identified and self-reported influences of contextual information on pain-related decisions. Fifty-four nurses viewed vignettes containing a video of a VH patient and text describing a postsurgical context. VH sex, race, age, and facial expression varied across vignettes. Participants made pain-assessment and treatment decisions on visual analogue scales. Participants subsequently indicated the information they relied on when making decisions. None of the participants reported using VH sex, race, or age in their decision process. Statistical modeling indicated that 28 to 54% of participants (depending on the decision) used VH demographic cues. 76% of participants demonstrated concordance between their reported and actual use of the VH facial expression cue. Vital signs, text-based clinical summary, and VH movement were also reported as influential factors. These data suggest that biases may be prominent in practitioner decision-making about pain, but that providers have minimal awareness of and/or a lack of willingness to acknowledge this bias. Perspective: The current study highlights the complexity of provider decision-making about pain management. The VH technology could be used in future research and education applications aimed at improving the care of all persons in pain.

Objectives: To investigate the influence of patient demographic characteristics and facial expressions on nurses’ assessment of patient mood in the context of pain. Design: A cross-sectional study employing Virtual Human (VH) technology and lens model methodology. Settings: The current study was delivered via the internet. Participants: Participants consisted of 54 registered nurses currently engaged in clinical practice. Nurses were recruited from healthcare settings across the United States. Methods: Nurses viewed 32 patient vignettes consisting of a video clip of the VH patient and text-based clinical summary information describing a post-surgical context. Patient sex, race, age, and facial expression of pain were systematically manipulated across vignettes. Participants made positive and negative mood assessment ratings on computerized visual analogue scales. Idiographic multiple regression analyses were used to examine the patient characteristics that were significant predictors of nurses’ assessment ratings. Nomothetic paired samples t-tests were used to compare ratings within cue for the entire sample. Results: The results of idiographic and nomothetic analyses indicated that VH sex, race, age, and facial expression cues were significant predictors of the mood assessment ratings of many nurses. The age cue had the largest impact among the demographic variables.

9,999,9,"Context. Ingestion of toxic liquids is common, and the volume ingested is often important for clinical decision-making. However, the accuracy and interpretation of volume estimates in the context of toxicological exposures is poorly characterised in adult practice. Objective. To inform the interpretation of volume estimates when expressed in forms commonly encountered in toxicological practice: (1) semi-quantitative volume descriptors, such as 'mouthfuls'; (2) quantitative self-estimates of ingestion volume, for example, millilitres; and (3) estimates of residual volume in containers. Methods. In the first part of the study, 50 members of the public ingested water in response to requests to take a 'small mouthful', 'large gulp' and 'five mouthfuls'. They estimated the amount ingested, and actual volumes were measured. In part 2, 15 members of the public and 15 healthcare professionals estimated the volumes contained in 12 opaque and transparent bottles. Results. The mean age of participants in part 1 was 37 years, and in part 2 it was 34 years.

The mean error (95% limits of agreement) for self-estimates of ingestion volume was an underestimate of -52% (-90% to + 124%). Volume contained in bottles was underestimated by -5% (-38% to + 27%).

Conclusions. Volume estimates derived from semi-quantitative descriptors are not a reliable basis for clinical decision-making. Self-estimates provided in a quantitative form are inaccurate and prone to underestimation. Estimates of residual volume in containers should be regarded as suspect if the container is opaque.

9,1000,4,"Evaluation of applicants for middle- and upper-level managerial positions and recommended starting salaries were examined in a sample of 44 male and 24 female line and staff managers. We postulated hypotheses that (a) managers would use job-relevant and job-irrelevant variables in evaluation of applicants, (b) the managers' selection decision models would involve configural cue processing, (c) managers' demographic characteristics would affect their evaluations of applicants for managerial positions, and (d) applicant sex and race would affect starting salary recommendations, after controlling for human capital variables. Subjects viewed videotaped presentations by 16 applicants and evaluated them for the job for which they were applying. Variables of applicant age, sex, race, experience, education, and level of job for which applying were manipulated. The results supported four of the five hypotheses.

9,1001,9,"Purpose: Physicians’ exposure to pharmaceutical industry marketing raises concerns about their ability to make unbiased, evidence-based prescription decisions. This exposure begins early in medical education. The authors examined the frequency and context of such exposures for students before matriculation to medical school. Method: The authors distributed two separate but related questionnaires to all 389 students who matriculated at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine between 2007 and 2010. The survey inquired about interactions with the pharmaceutical industry before entering medical school. Descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to analyze data. Results: Across four years, 282 (72.5%) students responded to the first survey; 219 (56.3%) responded to the follow-up survey. The majority of those (62.1%) had interacted with or were exposed to pharmaceutical marketing before medical school. The most common interactions were accepting a pen (50.2%) and attending a sponsored lunch (37.9%), which occurred most commonly while shadowing (33.6% and 42.2%, respectively). The next most common interactions were receiving a small gift (24.7%) and attending a sponsored dinner (20.6%), which occurred most commonly in “other” contexts, such as through family and while working in a medical setting (48.2% and 48.9%, respectively). Conclusions: The majority of students had interacted with the pharmaceutical industry before medical school. The differences in context indicate that students enter medical school with a heterogeneous set of exposures to pharmaceutical marketing. Medical schools should consider interventions to enhance students’ knowledge of the impact of pharmaceutical marketing on physicians’ prescribing practices.

This study explores obstetric physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and infant safe sleep and identifies barriers as well as enabling and/or reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with obstetric physicians who provide prenatal healthcare to women in Ohio. Surveys were sent to all licensed physicians included in the registry of the State Medical Board of Ohio with ""obstetrics,"" ""obstetrics and gynecology,"" or ""maternal and fetal medicine"" as their primary specialty (n = 1771). The response rate was 30%, with 418 physicians included in the analysis. Many participants were knowledgeable about infant safe sleep recommendations; however, only 55% indicated that it was important for obstetric physicians to discuss Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and/or infant safe sleep with prenatal patients. Many participants (70%) perceived barriers to providing infant safe sleep education, however most (82%) indicated interest in doing so. Participants' knowledge and attitudes were significant predictors of whether they discuss this topic with patients. Obstetric physicians can influence the infant safe sleep decisions that women make.

Provider‐related factors are hypothesized to contribute to unequal treatment, but these factors have not been examined extensively. This mixed methods investigation examined the influence of patients' demographic characteristics on providers' treatment decisions and providers' awareness of these influences on their treatment decisions. Methods: Twenty medical trainees made treatment decisions (opioid, antidepressant, physical therapy) for 16 virtual patients with chronic low back pain; patient sex and race were manipulated across patients. Participants then indicated from a provided list the factors that influenced their treatment decisions, including patient demographics. Finally, individual interviews were conducted to discuss the role of patient demographics on providers' clinical decisions. Results: Individual regression analyses indicated that 30% of participants were reliably influenced by patient sex and 15% by patient race when making their decisions ( P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.10). Group analyses indicated that white patients received higher antidepressant recommendations, on average, than black patients ( P &lt; 0.05). Half of the medical trainees demonstrated awareness of the influence of demographic characteristics on their decision making. Participants, regardless of whether they were influenced by patients' demographics, discussed themes related to patient sex and race; however, participants' discussion of patient demographics in the interviews did not always align with their online study results. Conclusions: These findings suggest there is a considerable variability in the extent to which medical trainees are influenced by patient demographics and their awareness of these decision making influences.

Specifically, the authors tested whether social exchange and job embeddedness mediate how mutual-investment (whereby employers offer high inducements to employees for their high contributions) and over-investment (high inducements without corresponding high expected contributions) EOR approaches, which are based on Tsui, Pearce, Porter, and Tripoli's (1997) framework, affect quit propensity and organizational commitment. Two studies evaluated these intervening mechanisms. Study 1 surveyed 953 Chinese managers attending part-time master of business administration (MBA) programs in China, whereas Study 2 collected cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 526 Chinese middle managers in 41 firms. Standard and multilevel causal modeling techniques affirmed that social exchange and job embeddedness translate EOR influence. A second multilevel test using lagged outcome measures further established that job embeddedness mediates long-term EOR effects over 18 months. These findings corroborate prevailing views that social exchange explains how mutual- and over-investment EORs motivate greater workforce commitment and loyalty. This study enriches EOR perspectives by identifying job embeddedness as another mediator that is more enduring than social exchange.

9,1008,9,"Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of nurse-led triage of outpatient referrals in an academic pediatric otolaryngology practice.Methods: Three hundred consecutive outpatient referrals were reviewed and triaged by two otolaryngology registered nurses and two attending pediatric otolaryngologists. The nurses received triage training. The referrals were triaged as 'routine' (to be seen within 2-3 months), 'semi-urgent' (to be seen within 6 weeks), or 'urgent' (to be seen within 2 weeks). Weighted Kappa statistics (correcting for chance agreement) were performed to assess for the degree of agreement. After the consultation visits, patient records were reviewed to determine whether any referrals had been inappropriately triaged by the nurses.Results: Overall, there was substantial agreement between all raters. Specifically, weighted Kappa statistics were as follows: surgeon 1, nurse 1: 0.708; surgeon 1, nurse 2: 0.670; surgeon 2, nurse 1: 0.762; surgeon 2, nurse 2: 0.647; nurse 1, nurse 2: 0.756; and surgeon 1, surgeon 2: 0.784. Review of patient charts after consultation showed that no referrals were deemed to be inappropriately triaged and no urgent cases had been missed.Conclusions: Our model of nurse-led triage of outpatient referrals was found to be effective and safe.

In this paper, we conjecture that judges may also have anti-speculator sentiment, which might affect their professional decision making. We asked 123 professional lawyers and 247 law students in Germany this question, and they clearly predicted that judges would have an anti-speculator bias. However, in an actual behavioral study, 185 judges did not exhibit such bias. In another sample of 170 professional lawyers, we found weak support for an anti-speculator bias. This evidence suggests that an independent audience may actually perceive unbiased judgments as biased.

Emergent themes were identified using grounded theory, with data coded using NVIVO 8.Participants: 16 patients, 4 relatives, (mean age (sd) 60 years (15); 12 female, 8 male) and 39 healthcare professionals, (9 pharmacists, 11 doctors, 12 nurses, 7 health care assistants).Setting: Participants were sampled from general medical and surgical wards, taking acute and elective admissions, in two hospitals in north east England.Results: Positive consequences were identified but some actions encouraged by current patient-mediated approaches elicited feelings of suspicion and mistrust. For example, patients felt speaking up might appear rude or disrespectful, were concerned about upsetting staff and worried that their care might be compromised. Staff, whilst apparently welcoming patient questions, appeared uncertain about patients' motives for questioning and believed that patients who asked many questions and/or who wrote things down were preparing to complain. Behavioural implications were identified that could serve to exacerbate patient safety problems (e. g. staff avoiding contact with inquisitive patients or relatives; patients avoiding contact with unreceptive staff).Conclusions: Approaches that aim to push improvement in patient safety through the involvement of patients could engender mistrust and create negative tensions in the patient-provider relationship.

A valid sample of 209 healthcare professionals was collected for data analysis.Results: The results show that healthcare professionals' resistance to the use of the health cloud is the result of regret avoidance, inertia, perceived value, switching costs, and perceived threat.

,1019,2,"Background While operating, surgeons are required to make cognitive decisions and often are interrupted to attend to questions from other members of the health care team. Technical automatization may be achieved by experienced surgeons such that these distractions have little effect on performance of either the surgical or the cognitive task. This study assessed the effect of adding a distracting cognitive task on performance of a basic laparoscopic skill by novice and experienced surgeons.Methods In this study, 31 novice (medical students in postgraduate years [PGYs] 1-2) and 9 experienced (fellows/ attendants and PGYs 4-5) laparoscopic surgeons practiced the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) laparoscopic peg transfer task until their scores stabilized. The mean normalized score after five repetitions then was recorded. The subjects also were tested on the number of mathematical addition questions they could answer in 1 min. This was repeated five times, with the mean number of questions attempted and the accuracy (% correct) recorded. The laparoscopic and addition tasks then were performed concurrently five times. Data, presented as mean +/- standard deviation, were analyzed using Student's t-test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results After practice to stable peg transfer performance, the baseline peg transfer score was higher in the experienced group (98 +/- 6 vs 87 +/- 12; p < 0.01). There were no baseline differences between the groups in the number of math questions attempted in 1 min (10 +/- 2 vs 9 +/- 2; p = 0.55) or the number of correct answers (9 +/- 3 vs 8 +/- 3; p = 0.36). The comparison of baseline performance and dual-task performance showed that the experienced surgeons had no decline in peg transfer score (98 +/- 6 vs 97 +/- 6; p = 0.48), number of questions attempted in 1 min (10 +/- 2 vs 9 +/- 3; p = 0.32), or number of correct answers (9 +/- 3 vs 8 +/- 3; p = 0.46). In contrast, dual-tasking among the novices was associated with a decrease in the number of questions attempted (9 +/- 2 vs 8 +/- 2; p < 0.01) and the number of correct answers (8 +/- 3 vs 7 +/- 2; p = 0.02), and with no change in the peg transfer score (87 +/- 12 vs 88 +/- 8; p = 0.38) compared with baseline.Conclusions Distraction significantly decreased a novice's ability to process cognitively based math problems, whereas there was no effect on experienced subjects. This occurred despite the fact that the novice group had practiced to high-level peg transfer scores at baseline. This suggests that the experienced surgeons had achieved automatization of the peg transfer basic surgical skill to a level that cognitive distraction did not affect performance of either task.

Ethical sensitivity is a prerequisite for nurses to make decisions in the best interest of their patients in daily practice. Currently, there is no tool for assessing ethical sensitivity in Chinese language, and no empirical studies of ethical sensitivity among Chinese nurses. Research objectives: The study was conducted to translate the Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire–Revised Version (MSQ-R) into Chinese and establish the psychometric properties of the Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire–Revised Version into Chinese (MSQ-R-CV). Research design: This research was a methodological and descriptive study. Participants and research context: MSQ-R was translated into Chinese using Brislin’s model, and the Translation Validity Index was evaluated. MSQ-R-CV was then distributed along with a demographic questionnaire to 360 nurses working at tertiary and municipal hospitals in Changsha, China. Ethical considerations: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Yale University and Central South University. Findings: MSQ-R-CV achieved Cronbach’s alpha 0.82, Spearman-Brown coefficient 0.75, significant item discrimination (p &lt; 0.001), and item-total correlation values ranging from 0.524 to 0.717. A two-factor structure was illustrated by exploratory factor analysis, and further confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis.

Discussion: The findings of this study were compared with studies from other countries to examine the structure and meaningful implications of ethical sensitivity in Chinese nurses. Conclusion: The two-factor MSQ-R-CV (moral responsibility and strength, and sense of moral burden) is a linguistically and culturally appropriate instrument for assessing ethical sensitivity among Chinese nurses.

9,1022,9,"Background Diagnostic errors result in preventable morbidity and mortality. The outpatient setting may be at increased risk, where time constraints, the indolent nature of outpatient complaints and single decision-maker practice models predominate.Methods We developed a self-administered diagnostic pause to address diagnostic error. Clinicians (physicians and nurse practitioners) in an academic primary care setting received the tool if they were seeing urgent care patients who had previously been seen in the past twoweeks in urgent care. We used pre-post-intervention surveys, focus groups and chart audits 6 months after the urgent care visit to assess the impact of the intervention on participant perceptions and actions.Results We piloted diagnostic pauses in two phases (3 months and 6 months, respectively); 9 physicians participated in the first phase, and 16 physicians and 2 nurse practitioners in the second phase. Subjects received 135 alerts for diagnostic pauses and responded to 82 (61% response). Thirteen per cent of alerts resulted in clinicians reporting new actions as a result of the diagnostic pauses. Thirteen per cent of cases at a 6-month chart audit resulted in diagnostic discrepancies, defined as differences in diagnosis from the initial working diagnosis. Focus groups reported that the diagnostic pauses were brief and fairly well integrated into the overall workflow for evaluation but would have benefited as a real-time application for patients at higher risk for diagnostic error.Conclusion This pilot represents the first known examination of diagnostic pauses in the outpatient setting, and this work potentially paves the way for more broad-based systems and/or electronic interventions to address diagnostic error.",Huang,2018,Implementation of diagnostic pauses in the ambulatory setting,BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY,27,492,497,Web of Science,"Huang, Grace C.; Kriegel, Gila; Wheaton, Carolyn; Sternberg, Scot; Sands, Kenneth; Richards, Jeremy; Johnston, Katherine; Aronson, Mark"

Ss received 1 of 8 case reports that varied by race, SES level, and 2 sets of group achievement results, creating 8 conditions. The decision to administer individual psychoeducational tests was influenced by group achievement test data, but not by the student's race or SES. Students who showed lower achievement test results were more likely to be recommended for testing than were those who showed average performance levels. Thus, Ss did not make biased decisions relating to the selection of students for testing, but were influenced by instructionally relevant data. When objective test data indicated average achievement levels, Ss did not generally recommend subsequent individual psychoeducational testing, suggesting that testing may not automatically follow receipt of a referral.

9,1025,9,"Racial disparities in the US criminal justice system (CJS) have been extensively documented in scholarly work. Critical race scholars have suggested that color-blind racial attitudes inform the set of beliefs that CJS practitioners use in decision making. If this is the case, factors that are related to color-blind racial attitude trends in CJS practitioners must be better understood. We focus on a single CJS practitioner—the police—to assess their color-blind racial beliefs and compare these to the broader US public. Using the Color-Blind Racial Attitudes Scale (CoBRAS), we identified sociodemographic variables associated with high CoBRAS scores in a multiracial lay sample ( N = 1401; males and females, mean age = 33.4 years). Police ( N = 112) and police recruits ( N = 52) CoBRAS scores were compared to CoBRAS scores of lay participants with similar sociodemographics as the police and recruit samples, (respectively, N = 451; N = 291). Police scored significantly higher on the CoBRAS than laypersons even when controlling for sociodemographic variables. Police recruits also have higher CoBRAS scores than laypersons, again controlling for sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that police work attracts people who endorse color-blind racial beliefs.

9,1026,4,"Background: A computer-assisted assessment (CAA) program for communication skills designated ACT was developed using the objective structured video examination (OSVE) format. This method features assessment of cognitive scripts underlying communication behaviour, a broad range of communication problems covered in 1 assessment, highly standardised assessment and rating procedures, and large group assessments without complex organisation. Setting: The Academic Medical Centre (AMC) at the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Aims: To describe the development of the AMC Communication Test (ACT); to describe our experiences with the examination and rating procedures; to present test score descriptives, and to present the students' opinions of ACT. Design: The ACT presents films on history taking, breaking bad news and shared decision making. Each film is accompanied by 3 types of short essay questions derived from our assessment model: 'knows', 'knows why/when' and 'knows how'. Evaluation questions about ACT were integrated into the assessment. Participants: A total of 210 third year medical undergraduates were assessed. This study reports on the 110 (53%) students who completed all evaluation questions. RESULTS Marking 210 examinations took about 17 days. The test score matched a normal distribution and showed a good level of discrimination of the students. About 75% passed the examination. Some support for the validity of our assessment model was found in the students' differential performance on the 3 types of questions. The ACT was well received. Student evaluations confirmed our efforts to develop realistic films that related well to the communication training programme. Conclusions: The ACT is a useful assessment method which complements interpersonal assessment methods for the evaluation of the medical communication skills of undergraduates.

9,1027,4,"Objective: Using standardized video cases in a computerized objective structured video examination (OSVE) aims to measure cognitive scripts underlying overt communication behavior by questions on knowledge, understanding and performance. In this study the reliability of the OSVE assessment is analyzed using the generalizability theory. Methods: Third year undergraduate medical students from the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam answered short-essay questions on three video cases, respectively about history taking, breaking bad news, and decision making. Of 200 participants, 116 completed all three video cases. Students were assessed in three shifts, each using a set of parallel case editions. About half of all available exams were scored independently by two raters using a detailed rating manual derived from the other half. Analyzed were the reliability of the assessment, the inter-rater reliability, and interrelatedness of the three types of video cases and their parallel editions, by computing a generalizability coefficient G. Results: The test score showed a normal distribution. The students performed relatively well on the history taking type of video cases, and relatively poor on decision making and did relatively poor on the understanding ('knows why/when') type of questions. The reliability of the assessment was acceptable (G = 0.66). It can be improved by including up to seven cases in the OSVE. The inter-rater reliability was very good (G = 0.93). The parallel editions of the video cases appeared to be more alike (G = 0.60) than the three case types (G = 0.47). Discussion: The additional value of an OSVE is the differential picture that is obtained about covert cognitive scripts underlying overt communication behavior in different types of consultations, indicated by the differing levels of knowledge, understanding and performance. The validation of the OSVE score requires more research. Conclusion and practice implications: A computerized OSVE has been successfully applied with third year undergraduate medical students. The test score meets psychometric criteria, enabling a proper discrimination between adequately and poorly performing students. The high inter-rater reliability indicates that a single rater is permitted.

We aimed to develop an understanding of what information is shared with mothers at risk of preterm delivery beyond periviability and to evaluate communication skills of our participants.METHODS: We developed a checklist of elements to include in counseling based on a comprehensive literature review. The checklist was divided into an information sharing section and a connect score. The information sharing list was sub-divided into general information and specific complications. Neonatologists engaged in a simulated prenatal counseling session with a standardized patient. Videotaped encounters were then analyzed for checklist elements.RESULTS: Neonatologists all scored well in communication using our tool and two other validated communication tools - the SEGUE and the analytic global OSCE. There was no difference in scoring based on years of experience or level of training. Information sharing from neonatologists more often discussed general information over specific. Neonatologists also focused more on early outcomes over long-term outcomes. Only 12% of neonatologists quoted the correct survival rate for the case.CONCLUSIONS: Neonatologists generally communicate well but share less information specific to prematurity and the long-term sequelae of prematurity.

In 3 studies, we seek to determine whether there are indeed negative stereotypes of students who have chosen a career in teaching, and whether the performance of these students is affected by stereotype threat. Responses to open-ended questions (Study 1, N = 82) and comparisons in closed-ended response format (Study 2, N = 120) showed that preservice teachers are perceived as having a low level of competence and a high level of warmth, in keeping with the paternalistic stereotype.

9,1036,4,"Objective: The goal of measuring therapist adherence is to determine whether a therapist can perform a given treatment. Yet, the evaluation of therapist behaviors in most clinical trials is limited. Typically, randomized trials have few therapists and minimize therapist variability through training and supervision. Furthermore, therapist adherence is confounded with uncontrolled differences in patients across therapists. Consequently, the extent to which adherence measures capture differences in actual therapist adherence versus other sources of variance is unclear. Method: We estimated intra-class correlations (ICCs) for therapist adherence in sessions with real and standardized patients (RPs and SPs), using ratings from a motivational interviewing (MI) dissemination trial (Baer et al., 2009) in which 189 therapists recorded 826 sessions with both patient types. We also examined the correlations of therapist adherence between SP and RP sessions, and the reliability of therapist level adherence scores with generalizability coefficients (GCs). Results: ICCs for therapist adherence were generally large (average ICC for SPs = .44; average ICC for RPs = .40), meaning that a given therapist’s adherence scores were quite similar across sessions. Both ICCs and GCs were larger for SP sessions compared to RPs on global measures of MI adherence, such as Empathy and MI Spirit. Correlations between therapist adherence with real and standardized patients were moderate to large on 3 of 5 adherence measures.

9,1039,9,"Recent research on the crossmodal integration of visual and auditory perception suggests that evaluations of emotional information in one sensory modality may tend toward the emotional value generated in another sensory modality. This implies that the emotions elicited by musical stimuli can influence the perception of emotional stimuli presented in other sensory modalities, through a top-down process. The aim of this work was to investigate how crossmodal perceptual processing influences emotional face recognition and how potential modulation of this processing induced by music could be influenced by the subject’s musical competence. We investigated how emotional face recognition processing could be modulated by listening to music and how this modulation varies according to the subjective emotional salience of the music and the listener’s musical competence. The sample consisted of 24 participants: 12 professional musicians and 12 university students (non-musicians). Participants performed an emotional go/no-go task whilst listening to music by Albeniz, Chopin, or Mozart. The target stimuli were emotionally neutral facial expressions. We examined the N170 Event-Related Potential (ERP) and behavioral responses (i.e., motor reaction time to target recognition and musical emotional judgment). A linear mixed-effects model and a decision-tree learning technique were applied to N170 amplitudes and latencies. The main findings of the study were that musicians’ behavioral responses and N170 is more affected by the emotional value of music administered in the emotional go/no-go task and this bias is also apparent in responses to the non-target emotional face. This suggests that emotional information, coming from multiple sensory channels, activates a crossmodal integration process that depends upon the stimuli emotional salience and the listener’s appraisal.

9,1046,4,"Previous research suggests the existence of an expert anticipatory advantage, whereby skilled sportspeople are able to predict an upcoming action by utilizing cues contained in their opponent's body kinematics. This ability is often inferred from ""occlusion"" experiments: information is systematically removed from first-person videos of an opponent, for example, by stopping a tennis video at the point of racket-ball contact, yet performance, such as discrimination of shot direction, remains above chance. In this study, we assessed the expert anticipatory advantage for tennis ground strokes via a modified approach, known as ""bubbles,"" in which information is randomly removed from videos in each trial. The bubbles profile is then weighted by trial outcome (i.e., a correct vs. incorrect discrimination) and combined across trials into a classification array, revealing the potential cues informing the decision. In two experiments (both with N = 34 skilled tennis players) we utilized either temporal or spatial bubbles, applying them to videos running from 0.8 to 0 s before the point of racket-ball contact (cf. Jalali et al., 2018). Results from the spatial experiment were somewhat suggestive of accrual from the torso region of the body, but were not compelling. Results from the temporal experiment, on the other hand, were clear: information was accrued mainly during the period immediately prior to racket-ball contact. This result is broadly consistent with prior work using nonstochastic approaches to video manipulation, and cannot be an artifact of temporal smear from information accrued after racket-ball contact, because no such information was present.",Jalali,2019,Information Accrual From the Period Preceding Racket-Ball Contact for Tennis Ground Strokes: Inferences From Stochastic Masking,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,10,,,Web of Science,"Jalali, Sepehr; Martin, Sian E.; Ghose, Tandra; Buscombe, Richard M.; Solomon, Joshua A.; Yarrow, Kielan"
9,1047,4,"Advance the methodological techniques used to examine the influence of suspect race and ethnicity on participant decisions to shoot in an experimental setting.After developing and testing a novel set of 60 realistic, high definition video deadly force scenarios based on 30 years of official data on officer-involved shootings in the United States, three separate experiments were conducted testing police (n = 36), civilian (n= 72) and military (n = 6) responses (n = 1,812) to the scenarios in high-fidelity computerized training simulators. Participants' responses to White, Black and Hispanic suspects in potentially deadly situations were analyzed using a multi-level mixed methods strategy. Key response variables were reaction time to shoot and shooting errors.In all three experiments using a more externally valid research method than previous studies, we found that participants took longer to shoot Black suspects than White or Hispanic suspects. In addition, where errors were made, participants across experiments were more likely to shoot unarmed White suspects than unarmed Black or Hispanic suspects, and were more likely to fail to shoot armed Black suspects than armed White or Hispanic suspects. In sum, this research found that participants displayed significant bias favoring Black suspects in their decisions to shoot.The results of these three experiments challenge the results of less robust experimental designs and shed additional light on the broad issue of the role that status characteristics, such as race and ethnicity, play in the criminal justice system. Future research should explore the generalizability of these findings, determine whether bias favoring Black suspects is a consequence of administrative measures (e.g., education, training, policies, and laws), and identify the cognitive processes that underlie this phenomenon.",James,2013,"Results from experimental trials testing participant responses to White, Hispanic and Black suspects in high-fidelity deadly force judgment and decision-making simulations",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CRIMINOLOGY,9,189,212,Web of Science,"James, Lois; Vila, Bryan; Daratha, Kenn"
9,1048,4,"Background: Trauma triage decisions can be influenced by both knowledge and experience. Consequently, there may be substantial variability in computed tomography (CT) scans desired by emergency medicine physicians, surgical chief residents, and attending trauma surgeons. We quantified this difference and studied the effects of each group's decisions on missed injuries, cost, and radiation exposure.Methods: All blunt trauma activations at an urban level 1 trauma center were studied over a 6-mo period. Three months into the study, a pan-scan protocol was introduced. Prior to CT imaging, providers separately completed a survey that asked which CT scans were desired for each patient. Based on the completed surveys, hypothetical missed injuries, radiation exposure, and cost were determined.Results: The variability in the number of CT scans desired by each of the three providers and the resulting cost and radiation exposure were not statistically significant. Substantial variability was predominantly seen in the indications for the desired scans, with the difference between proportions ranging from 3.1%-68.7%. Agreement among the three providers was highest for head and c-spine scans (80%-100%) and lowest for maxillary face (57%-80%) and chest scans (52%-74%). Overall, the missed injury rate was similar for all the providers; chief residents missed significantly more major injuries than trauma attendings during the pan-scan period (P = 0.03).Conclusions: Trauma training and level of training did not have a substantial effect on radiological decisions during the initial trauma assessment. This study sheds light on the growing uniformity among providers with regard to medical decision-making in the initial work-up of trauma. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

9,1049,4,"Objective: The aim of this study was development of a sonification scheme to convey deviations in heart rate and oxygen saturation from a desired target level.Background: Maintaining physiologic parameters, such as oxygen saturation, within desired ranges, is challenging in many clinical situations. High rates of false positive alarms in clinical settings limit the utility of the alarms that trigger when thresholds are exceeded. Auditory displays that consider the semantic connotations of sounds and the processing limitations of human perception and cognition may improve monitoring.Method: Across two experiments, clinical practitioners were tested on their ability to (a) discriminate pairs of sounds (two-note discrimination task), (b) infer and discern the intended physiological connotation of each acoustic attribute (name-the-variable task), and (c) categorize the amount of change in an implied physiological variable into three levels of change: none, small, and large (change-magnitude task).Results: Considerable variation in performance was observed across the set of practitioners, ranging from near-perfect performance on all tasks, even with no prior exposure to the stimuli, to failure to reach a target accuracy criterion of 87.5% after similar to 80 min of training. On average, performance was well above chance on the name-the-variable and change-magnitude tasks during initial exposure and reached criterion within similar to 20 min of training on each task.Conclusion: The described sonification strategy may effectively communicate information about current heart rate and oxygen saturation status relative to desired target levels.Application: The results can be applied to clinical monitoring settings in which a stream of discrete auditory informational items is indicated.",Janata,2013,A Novel Sonification Strategy for Auditory Display of Heart Rate and Oxygen Saturation Changes in Clinical Settings,HUMAN FACTORS,55,356,372,Web of Science,"Janata, Petr; Edwards, William H."
9,1050,9,"Although practice has long been known to improve perceptual performance, the neural basis of this improvement in humans remains unclear. Using fMRI in conjunction with a novel signal detection-based analysis, we show that extensive practice selectively enhances the neural representation of trained orientations in the human visual cortex. Twelve observers practiced discriminating small changes in the orientation of a laterally presented grating over 20 or more daily 1 h training sessions. Training on average led to a twofold improvement in discrimination sensitivity, specific to the trained orientation and the trained location, with minimal improvement found for untrained orthogonal orientations or for orientations presented in the untrained hemifield. We measured the strength of orientation-selective responses in individual voxels in early visual areas (V1-V4) using signal detection measures, both before and after training. Although the overall amplitude of the BOLD response was no greater after training, practice nonetheless specifically enhanced the neural representation of the trained orientation at the trained location. This training-specific enhancement of orientation-selective responses was observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) as well as higher extrastriate visual areas V2-V4, and moreover, reliably predicted individual differences in the behavioral effects of perceptual learning. These results demonstrate that extensive training can lead to targeted functional reorganization of the human visual cortex, refining the cortical representation of behaviorally relevant information.",Jehee,2012,Perceptual Learning Selectively Refines Orientation Representations in Early Visual Cortex,JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE,32,16747,+,Web of Science,"Jehee, Janneke F.

Would available evidence-based assessment (EBA) strategies help improve diagnostic accuracy and are clinicians willing to consider these strategies in practice? The purpose of the present study was to document the extent to which using an EBA decision tool—a probability nomogram—improves the interpretation of family history and test data by clinicians and to examine the acceptability of the nomogram technique to clinicians. Over 600 clinicians across the U.S. and Canada attending continuing education seminars were trained to use the nomogram. Participants estimated the probability that a youth in a clinical vignette had bipolar disorder, first using clinical judgment and then using the nomogram. Brief training of clinicians (less than 30 minutes) in using the nomogram for assessing PBD improved diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and agreement. The majority of clinicians endorsed using the nomogram in practice. EBA decision aids, such as the nomogram, may lead to a significant decrease in overdiagnosis and help clinicians detect true cases of PBD.

9,1052,4,"Effective decision support systems must supply decision makers with information that allows them to make correct judgments. Unfortunately, human intuitive judgments are subject to a number of biases. Among the judgments that a user of a decision support system must make is the selection of an appropriate model. When a decision maker is presented with a history of a model's usage and frequency of success during that usage, the decision maker must judge how confident he/she is in the output that comes from that model. We show, in a laboratory setting using 75 student subjects and 48 managers, that decision makers can be manipulated into irrational confidence levels.

9,1053,review,"Objective: To identify pressures created by surgical culture and social setting and explore mechanisms for how they might impact operative decision-making.Background: Surgeons apply judgments within a powerful social context and are constantly socialized and influenced by communicative exchanges. In this study, the authors characterized the nature of the surgical social context, focusing on the interactions between external social influences and the cognitive ability of the surgeon to respond to uncertain, unexpected, or critical moments in operations.Methods: The authors reviewed the sociological and psychosocial literatures to examine concepts in identity construction, socialization process, and image management literatures and synthesized a conceptual framework allowing for the examination of how social factors and image management might impact surgical performance.Results: The surgeon's professional identity is constructed and negotiated on the basis of the context of surgical culture. Trainees are socialized to display confidence and certainty as part of the ""hidden curriculum"" and several sociocultural mechanisms regulating ""appropriate"" surgical behavior exist in this system. In the image management literature, individuals put on a ""front"" or social performance that is socially acceptable. Several mechanisms for how image management might impact surgical judgment and decision-making were identified through an exploration of the cognitive psychology literature.Conclusions: Sociopsychological literatures can be linked with decision-making and cognitive capacity theory. When cognitive resources reach their limit during critical and uncertain moments of an operation, the consumption of resources by the pressures of reputation and ego might interfere with the thought processes needed to execute the task at hand.

9,1055,9,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The general population and most physicians have implicit racial bias against black adults. Pediatricians also have implicit bias against black adults, albeit less than other specialties. There is no published research on the implicit racial attitudes of pediatricians or other physicians toward children. Our objectives were to compare implicit racial bias toward adults versus children among resident physicians working in a pediatric emergency department, and to assess whether bias varied by specialty (pediatrics, emergency medicine, or other), gender, race, age, and year of training.METHODS: We measured implicit racial bias of residents before a pediatric emergency department shift using the Adult and Child Race Implicit Association Tests (IATs). Generalized linear models compared Adult and Child IAT scores and determined the association of participant demographics with Adult and Child IAT scores.RESULTS: Among 91 residents, we found moderate pro-white/anti-black bias on both the Adult (mean = 0.49, standard deviation = 0.34) and Child Race IAT (mean = 0.55, standard deviation = 0.37). There was no significant difference between Adult and Child Race IAT scores (difference = 0.06, P = .15). Implicit bias was not associated with resident demographic characteristics, including specialty.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating that resident physicians have implicit racial bias against black children, similar to levels of bias against black adults.

9,1056,4,"Although mold air sampling is technically straightforward, interpreting the results to decide if there is an indoor source is not. Applying formal statistical tests to mold sampling data is an error-prone practice due to the extreme data variability. With neither established exposure limits nor useful statistical techniques, indoor air quality investigators often must rely on their professional judgment, but the lack of a consensus ""decision strategy"" incorporating explicit decision criteria requires professionals to establish their own personal set of criteria when interpreting air sampling data. This study examined the level of agreement among indoor air quality practitioners in their evaluation of airborne mold sampling data and explored differences in inter-evaluator assessments. Eighteen investigators independently judged 30 sets of viable mold air sampling results to indicate: ""definite indoor mold source,"" ""likely indoor mold source,"" ""not enough information to decide,"" ""likely no indoor mold source,"" or ""definitely no indoor mold source."" Kappa coefficient analysis indicated weak inter-observer reliability, and comparison of evaluator mean scores showed clear inter-evaluator differences in their overall scoring patterns. The responses were modeled on indicator ""traits"" of the data sets using a generalized, linear mixed model approach and showed several traits to be associated with respondents' ratings, but they also demonstrated distinct and divergent inter-evaluator response patterns. Conclusions were that there was only weak overall agreement in evaluation of the mold sampling data, that particular traits of the data were associated with the conclusions reached, and that there were substantial inter-evaluator differences that were likely due to differences in the personal decision criteria employed by the individual evaluators. The overall conclusion was that there is a need for additional work to rigorously explore the constellation of decision criteria, the weightings employed by individual practitioners, and the rationale under which criteria are adopted as first steps toward the larger goal of developing a consensus mold decision strategy.",Johnson,2008,Professional judgment and the interpretation of viable mold air sampling data.,Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,5,656,63,Web of Science,"Johnson, David; Thompson, David; Clinkenbeard, Rodney; Redus, Jason"

Since 2009, the Severn Postgraduate Deanery School of Surgery in the UK has developed a 1-day human-factors training course specifically designed for junior surgical trainees.METHODS: Analysis of post-course feedback on self-assessed confidence in the use of non-technical skills was undertaken for all junior surgical trainees undertaking the course in 2012/13.RESULTS: Thirty-three junior surgical trainees attended the 1-day human-factors training course. In all, 91 per cent of trainees reported that the course would change their practice. There was a statistically significant difference between the self-assessed confidence of trainees in the use of all four categories of non-technical skills (p ≤ 0.001) before and after the course.DISCUSSION: The Severn Deanery offers a compulsory human-factors training course for surgeons at the start of their career.

9,1061,4,"OBJECTIVE: Although designed as a low-stakes formative examination, the American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) is often used in high-stakes decisions such as promotion, remediation, and retention owing to its perceived ability to predict the outcome of board certification. Because of the discrepancy between intent and use, the ability of ABSITE scores to predict passing the American Board of Surgery certification examinations was analyzed.METHODS: All first-time American Board of Surgery qualifying examination (QE) examinees between 2006 and 2012 were reviewed. Examinees' postgraduate year (PGY) 1 and PGY5 ABSITE standard scores were linked to QE scores and pass/fail outcomes (n = 6912 and 6846, respectively) as well as first-time certifying examination (CE) pass/fail results (n = 1329). Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the utility of ABSITE scores to predict board certification scores and pass/fail outcomes.RESULTS: PGY1 ABSITE scores accounted for 22% of the variance in QE scores (p < 0.001). PGY5 scores were a slightly better predictor, accounting for 30% of QE score variance (p < 0.001). Analyses showed that selecting a PGY5 ABSITE score that maximized overall decision accuracy for predicting QE pass/fail outcomes (86% accuracy) resulted in 98% sensitivity, 13% specificity, a positive predictive value of 87%, and a negative predictive value of 57%. ABSITE scores were not predictive of success on the CE.CONCLUSIONS: ABSITE scores are a useful predictor of QE scores and outcomes but do not predict passing the CE.

These issues might particularly appear in the context of “age discrimination”, “respect for autonomy”, “respect for privacy” and “decision-making competency”. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency rates of various geriatric ethical problems and to evaluate the importance given to these problems in primary healthcare. Methods: In order to evaluate the opinions, a questionnaire tool was formulated. The participants were asked to review the list of geriatric ethical issues, to state the frequency of encountering them and to identify the importance ratings for each issue. The sample consisted of 86 primary healthcare professionals (50 physicians and 36 nurses) aged between 24 and 50 years. Results: Based on the results, the most frequently encountered ethical issues were on “decision-making competency” and these issues respectively were “decision-making with relatives instead of elder patients”, “not informing elders due to the lack of tolerance” and “not informing elders due to the lack of comprehending”. The most important geriatric ethical issues were “ignoring respect for privacy”, “ignoring patient’s complaints” and “rejecting detailed examination or treatment because of age”. Conclusion: Overall, the results show that the nurses and physicians in primary healthcare frequently encounter geriatric ethical problems related to the decision-making process, which is a common issue for Turkey as a paternalistic society.

9,1068,9,"This Article reports the results of a study on whether political predispositions influence judicial decisionmaking. The study was designed to overcome the two principal limitations on existing empirical studies that purport to find such an influence: the use of nonexperimental methods to assess the decisions of actual judges; and the failure to use actual judges in ideologically-biased-reasoning experiments.

When the study subjects were assigned to analyze statutory interpretation problems, however, only the responses of the general-public subjects and not those of the judges varied in patterns that reflected the subjects' cultural values. The responses of a sample of lawyers (n = 217) were also uninfluenced by their cultural values; the responses of a sample of law students (n = 284), in contrast, displayed a level of cultural bias only modestly less pronounced than that observed in the general-public sample.

This article investigates how contextual cues signaling threat or safety interact with the race of the target to moderate shooter bias. Across two experimental studies using a first person shooter task, participants viewed Black or White male targets who held either a neutral (wallet or cellphone) or dangerous (gun) object. Study 1 manipulated the perceived safety or threat associated with the neighborhood context these shooting decisions occurred in, and Study 2 manipulated the perceived safety or threat associated with the targets' clothing. Participants made quick decisions to shoot or not shoot the presented target, with error rates serving as the dependent variable. Across both studies, results confirmed that racial bias in shooting decisions against Blacks was present in perceived threatening neighborhoods and in perceived threatening clothing, and it was reduced in perceived safe neighborhoods and when wearing perceived safe clothing. Results help to identify contextual factors that may lead to mistaken shooting decisions, which can be used to improve police training and decision making to reduce bias.",Kahn,2017,"What Influences Shooter Bias?

9,1070,9,"The philosophy of public health nursing is based on the belief that care directed towards the individual, his family and different social groups, contributes to the protection of overall population health. Nurses' care for health is not limited only to age or different disease groups, but it refers to all other activities which contribute to health improvement prevention, rehabilitation, concern for social justice, reducing disparities in providing health care services, and advocating the interests of community members. It is an unavoidable fact that every health situation includes a set of value judgements or norms, therefore even) decision that is made has in itself a moral component as well. There is a small number of research dealing with examining the capacity for cognition of moral dilemmas, moral deliberation, decision-making and implementing those decisions in nursing practice, especially in public health nursing.Since almost one third of the nurses (about ten thousand) in the Croatian health system work in community health care the aim of the authors was to determine how well the nurses were informed about the formal bodies that deal with ethical questions in their institutions (ethical committees) and wider community, and the number of nurses who are members of these committees; whether they know who to refer to for help in identifying and solving their ethical problem (formal bodies, health and other institutions) and how they perceive their capability in identifying and solving an ethical problem. Another aim was to determine which moral dilemmas nurses encounter in their everyday practice. The results of the research would be used for the advancement of nursing practice in public health nursing in the Republic of Croatia.The sample consisted of 300 nurses, out of which 200 finished secondary level of education, 100 finished undergraduate and graduate study programme. A questionnaire on how well the nurses are informed and how they perceive their knowledge and skills in the field of nursing ethics. The questionnaire consisted of 16 questions and one open-ended question where nurses could write about most often encountered moral dilemmas in their practice.The results of the research have shown that nurses who work in community are not sufficiently informed about the existence and formal structure of the bodies that deal with ethical questions in their institutions and wider community, and that they do not perceive their knowledge and skills as being sufficient for dealing with moral dilemmas in practical situations. Furthermore, it can be noted that, during stating ethical dilemmas they encounter in everyday practice, they are a lot more oriented towards themselves, mutual relations in the team and moral dilemmas which come within the competence of a doctor while not mentioning the issues of social justice, disparity in providing health services, as well as issues of being informed, dignity and mistanasia of community members. The reasons for that are to be found in a deficient theoretical education in the field of their professional ethics, especially when considering nurses with a secondary level education. Even though the nurses with higher education demonstrate more theoretical knowledge and understanding, they have not demonstrated sufficient confidence in three questions that are essential for practical application of knowledge and skills.",Kalauz,2013,Ethical aspects in community nursing in Croatia,PERIODICUM BIOLOGORUM,115,561,566,Web of Science,"Kalauz, Sonja; Klanjcic, Martina; Kurtovic, Biljana"
9,1071,4,"Objectives: To examine primary care physician (PCP) contributions toward racial and sex differences in the diagnosis and treatment of late-life depression. Design: Survey using a computerized instrument incorporating video interviews and text, with volunteer PCPs randomly assigned to one of four standardized video vignettes of an elderly patient depicting late-life depression. Vignettes differed only in the patient/actor's race (white/African-American) or sex. Setting: American Academy of Family Physicians meeting, San Diego, California, 2002. Participants: One hundred seventy-eight U.S.-practicing postresidency PCPs who were asked to participate in a clinical decision-making study. Measurements: The computerized survey instrument assessed PCPs' diagnoses, first-line treatment and management recommendations, and judgment of personal characteristics/behaviors for the patients in the vignettes. Results: Eighty-five percent of all PCPs correctly diagnosed the elderly patient(s) with major depression. There were no significant differences in the diagnosis of depression, treatment recommendations, or PCP assessment of most patient characteristics by the race or sex of the patient/actor in the vignette, but PCP characteristics, most notably the location of medical school training (U.S. vs international), affected the likelihood of a depression diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Conclusion: Given standardized symptom-pictures, PCPs are just as likely to diagnose and treat depression in African-American as in white older people, suggesting that bias based simply on apparent patient race is not a likely explanation for the lower rates of depression diagnosis and treatment in older African Americans. PCPs who have trained at international medical schools may benefit from targeted training initiatives on the diagnosis and treatment of late-life depression.

9,1075,4,"Objectives: In Sweden, reports indicate surprisingly large regional variation in prescription of biological drugs despite a growing number of clinical studies describing their beneficial effects and guidelines by professional organizations and agencies. Our objectives were to ascertain whether there is also variation between individual rheumatologists in prescribing biologics to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to evaluate reasons for treatment choices.Method: Ten hypothetical patient cases were constructed and presented to 26 rheumatologists in five regions in Sweden. The cases were based on actual cases and were thoroughly elaborated by a senior rheumatologist and pre-tested in a pilot study. The respondents were asked whether they would treat the patients with a biological agent (Yes/No) and to explain their decisions.Results: The response rate was 26/105 (25%). Treatment choices varied considerably between the rheumatologists, some prescribing biologics to 9/10 patients and others to 2/10. In five of the 10 hypothetical cases, approximately half of the respondents would prescribe biologics. No regions with particularly high or low prescription were identified. Both the decisions to prescribe biologics and also not to prescribe biologics were mainly motivated by medical reasons. Some rheumatologists also referred to lifestyle-related factors or the social function of the patient.Conclusions: The choice of initiation of biologics varied substantially among rheumatologists presented with hypothetical patient cases, and there were also disparities between rheumatologists practicing at the same clinic. Treatment choices were motivated primarily by medical reasons.

Also, a small number (18%) left coaching for reasons such as opportunity for promotion. Six women from the survey sample were individually interviewed. Through a descriptive analytic strategy and indexing process (Creswell, 1998), three general themes emerged: (a) gender disparities in women's work, (b) technical demands of coaching, and (c) college coaching and normalized sexualities.

9,1077,9,"Objective: Medication order voiding allows clinicians to indicate that an existing order was placed in error. We explored whether the order voiding function could be used to record and study medication ordering errors.Materials and Methods: We examined medication orders from an academic medical center for a 6-year period (2006-2011; n = 5 804 150). We categorized orders based on status (void, not void) and clinician-provided reasons for voiding. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate the association between order voiding and clinician, patient, and order characteristics. We conducted chart reviews on a random sample of voided orders (n = 198) to investigate the rate of medication ordering errors among voided orders, and the accuracy of clinician-provided reasons for voiding.Results: We found that 0.49% of all orders were voided. Order voiding was associated with clinician type (physician, pharmacist, nurse, student, other) and order type (inpatient, prescription, home medications by history). An estimated 70 +/- 10% of voided orders were due to medication ordering errors. Clinician-provided reasons for voiding were reasonably predictive of the actual cause of error for duplicate orders (72%), but not for other reasons.Discussion and Conclusion: Medication safety initiatives require availability of error data to create repositories for learning and training. The voiding function is available in several electronic health record systems, so order voiding could provide a low-effort mechanism for self-reporting of medication ordering errors.

,1078,2,"Decision making groups, including European juries, often contain factions differing in status. 16 5-person mock juries composed of trained and layperson status factions decided guilt and punishment for realistic cases of university code violations. Trained factions consisted of 8 graduate students (mean age 24.6 yrs) and lay factions consisted of 48 undergraduates (mean age 18.6 yrs). Cases presented predominantly intellective or judgmental issues, and juries had to justify verdicts according to facts alone, or facts and values. Compared to laypersons, trained factions influenced group decisions more, but only in judgmental cases, or when having to include values in justification. They more actively discussed the judgmental cases, and engaged more than laypersons in normative influence. Trained jurors appear to wield social/normative power, impacting judgmental issues more. Consistent with their minority status, laypersons engage in more informational than normative influence. The fact that laypersons are as active in discussing intellective cases as are trained members, and are equally informational in their style of influence, enhances their impact when deciding issues that revolve around gathering facts to reach a correct decision.

9,1079,9,"When confessions are entered into evidence in criminal courts, issues of coercion and voluntariness are important and often contested matters. Occasionally, defense attorneys proffer expert witnesses to testify about the coercive pressures of an interrogation and the risk of a false confession. Such testimony is often ruled inadmissible on the grounds that it does not inform the jury beyond its common knowledge. In our effort to test this judicial assumption about common knowledge, we surveyed jury-eligible laypeople (n = 67) and social scientists specializing in interrogation and confessions (n = 54) regarding their opinions about the coerciveness of prohibited interrogation tactics, maximization techniques, minimization techniques, and suspect risk factors and compared their ratings with a set of independent t tests. Laypeople gave lower ratings to the coerciveness of all sets of items representing interrogation techniques, and lower ratings to the vulnerabilities associated with suspect risk factors, as compared to social science experts. The disparities between laypeople's and experts' perceptions of coercion in interrogations demonstrate that such issues are not fully within the common knowledge of prospective jurors, and suggest the need to provide jurors with expert witness guidance when tasked with evaluating confession evidence.",Kaplan,2019,Perceptions of coercion in interrogation: comparing expert and lay opinions,PSYCHOLOGY CRIME & LAW,,,,Web of Science,"Kaplan, Jeffrey; Cutler, Brian L.; Leach, Amy-May; Marion, Stephanie; Eastwood, Joseph"

Consistent with much recent research, students were generally more accurate than police, and accuracy rates were higher among those presented with audiotaped than videotaped confessions. In addition, investigators were significantly more confident in their judgments and also prone to judge confessors guilty. To determine if police accuracy would increase if this guilty response bias were neutralized, participants in a second experiment were specifically informed that half the confessions were true and half were false. This manipulation eliminated the investigator response bias, but it did not increase accuracy or lower confidence.

9,1083,4,"Objective: The current study developed an online hangar talk survey (HTS) to solicit narratives describing challenging scenarios that professional pilots encountered during the hours-building phase of their career. Background: The predicted pilot shortage will effectively reduce the minimum flying hours required for pilots to be hired at an airline, resulting in less opportunity to develop nontechnical skills naturalistically. To compensate, threat and error data from the hours-building phase of a pilot’s career are required to inform training development. Pilots often share stories of such experiences, colloquially termed “hangar talk.” Method: The HTS gathered 132 narrative descriptions of general aviation (GA) events from pilots along with the event’s impact and whether the pilots would react differently if the scenario were encountered again. Results: The distribution of threats reported by GA pilots was similar to that reported at the airline level. Logistic regression analysis revealed that decision-making errors were associated with recognition of the need to react differently in the future, and decision-making errors and proficiency errors were associated with greater perceived impact on skill development. Conclusion: The current HTS solicited an array of data similar to the findings of airline-based threat and error observations. Pilots perceive decision-making and proficiency errors as impactful on skill development. Application: An HTS can be used to gather naturalistic threat and error data and to create a database of operational stories that can be used to develop nontechnical training based on narrative thought.

To verify this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of baseball experience or skill levels on simple reaction times and Go/Nogo reaction times in 82 university students (22 baseball players, 22 tennis players, and 38 nonathletes) and 17 professional baseball players. Also, to clarify whether this ability was innate or acquired, we examined the effects of long-term practice for baseball fitting in 94 senior high school students (26 baseball players and 68 non-baseball players). There were no differences in simple reaction time either for sports experience or for skill levels. On the contrary, the Go/Nogo reaction time for baseball players was significantly shorter than that of the tennis players and nonathletes. The Go/Nogo reaction time of higher-skill baseball players was significantly shorter than that of lower-skill players, while that of the professional baseball players was the shortest. The professional players showed the highest (almost linear) correlation between the Go/Nogo reaction time and simple reaction time. A longitudinal study showed that 2 years of hitting practice improved the Go/Nogo reaction time, while the simple reaction time remained constant. A cross-sectional study of high school non-baseball players showed no differences either in the simple or Go/Nogo reaction times in relation to school year.

9,1088,4,"Background: Clinical reasoning is a key competence in medicine. There is a lack of knowledge, how non-experts like medical students solve clinical problems. It is known that they have difficulties applying conceptual knowledge to clinical cases, that they lack metacognitive awareness and that higher level cognitive actions correlate with diagnostic accuracy. However, the role of conceptual, strategic, conditional, and metacognitive knowledge for clinical reasoning is unknown.Methods: Medical students (n = 21) were exposed to three different clinical cases and instructed to use the think-aloud method. The recorded sessions were transcribed and coded with regards to the four different categories of diagnostic knowledge (see above). The transcripts were coded using the frequencies and time-coding of the categories of knowledge. The relationship between the coded data and accuracy of diagnosis was investigated with inferential statistical methods.Results: The use of metacognitive knowledge is correlated with application of conceptual, but not with conditional and strategic knowledge. Furthermore, conceptual and strategic knowledge application is associated with longer time on task. However, in contrast to cognitive action levels the use of different categories of diagnostic knowledge was not associated with better diagnostic accuracy.Conclusions: The longer case work and the more intense application of conceptual knowledge in individuals with high metacognitive activity may hint towards reduced premature closure as one of the major cognitive causes of errors in medicine.

Each paper was scored using the triage sieve algorithm. The paper contained descriptions of two casualties regarded as dead, six priority 1 casualties, six priority 2 casualties, and six priority 3 casualties.Results: There was no significant difference in the scores received by both doctors and nurses, but paramedics did significantly less well than both nurses and doctors (p<0.05) However, the actual difference in mean scores is only just over I; both doctors and nurses had a mean score of 13.03 and paramedics a mean score of 11.83.

,1090,2,"INTRODUCTION: British police officers authorized to carry firearms may need to make judgments about the severity of injury of individuals or the relative priority of clinical need of a group of injured patients in tactical and non-tactical situations. Most of these officers receive little or no medical training beyond basic first aid to enable them to make these clinical decisions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the accuracy of triage decision-making of firearms-trained police officers with and without printed decision-support materials.METHODS: Eighty-two police firearms officers attending a tactical medicine course (FASTAid) were recruited to the study. Data were collected using a paper-based triage exercise that contained brief, clinical details of 20 adults and 10 children. Subjects were asked to assign a clinical priority of immediate or priority 1 (P1); urgent or priority 2 (P2); delayed or priority 3 (P3); or dead, to each casualty. Then, they were provided with decision-making materials, but were not given any instruction as to how these materials should be used. Subjects then completed a second triage exercise, identical to the first, except this time using the decision-support materials. Data were analyzed using mixed between-within subjects analysis of variance. This allowed comparisons to be made between the scores for Exercise 1 (no decision-support material) and Exercise 2 (with decision-support material). It also allowed any differences between those students with previous triage training and those without previous training to be explored.RESULTS: The use of triage decision-making materials resulted in a significant increase in correct responses (p < 0.001). Improvement in accuracy appears to result mainly from a reduction in the extent of under-triage. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) between those who had received previous triage training and those who had not, with those having received triage training doing slightly better.CONCLUSION: It appears that significant improvements in the accuracy of triage decision-making by police firearms officers can be achieved with the use of appropriate triage decision-support materials. Training may offer additional improvements in accuracy, but this improvement is likely to be small when decision-support materials are provided. With basic clinical skills and appropriate decision-support materials, it is likely that the police officer can make accurate triage decisions in a multiple-casualty scenario or make judgments of the severity of injury of a given individual in both tactical and non-tactical situations.",Kilner,2005,Triage decisions of United Kingdom police firearms officers using a multiple-casualty scenario paper exercise.,Prehospital and disaster medicine,20,40,6,Web of Science,"Kilner, Tim; Hall, F John"
9,1091,4,"Background. In assessing potential cases of major depressive disorder (MDD), to what extent do clinicians interpret symptoms within the explanatory context of major life stressors? Past research suggests that when clinicians know a plausible life event cause for a person's disordered symptoms, they generally judge that person to be less abnormal than if the cause was unknown. However, the current, fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders specifies that only bereavement-related life events exclude a client from a diagnosis of MDD, and the upcoming fifth edition of the manual (DSM-V) is currently slated to eliminate this bereavement clause altogether. Objective. To systematically examine whether clinicians' judgments reflect agreement with either of these formal DSM specifications. Method. In a controlled experiment, 72 practicing, licensed clinical psychologists made judgments about realistic MDD vignettes that included a bereavement event, stressful non-bereavement event, neutral event, or no event. Results. Bonferroni-corrected paired comparisons revealed that both bereavement and non-bereavement life events led MDD symptoms to be rated as significantly less indicative of a depression diagnosis, less abnormal, less rare, and less culturally unacceptable (all P <= 0.001) relative to control conditions. Limitations. Clinicians made judgments of realistic, controlled vignettes rather than patients. Conclusions. The results suggest that practicing clinical psychologists assess symptoms within the explanatory context of bereavement and non-bereavement life stressors, indicating a departure from the DSM's recommendations, both current and proposed.

9,1093,4,"Practicing clinicians frequently think about behaviors both abstractly (i.e., in terms of symptoms, as in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., DSM–5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and concretely (i.e., in terms of individual clients, as in DSM–5 Clinical Cases; Barnhill, 2013). Does abstract/concrete framing influence clinical judgments about behaviors? Practicing mental health clinicians (N = 74) were presented with hallmark symptoms of 6 disorders framed abstractly versus concretely, and provided ratings of their biological and psychological bases (Experiment 1) and the likely effectiveness of medication and psychotherapy in alleviating them (Experiment 2). Clinicians perceived behavioral symptoms in the abstract to be more biologically and less psychologically based than when concretely described, and medication was viewed as more effective for abstractly than concretely described symptoms. These findings suggest a possible basis for miscommunication and misalignment of views between primarily research-oriented and primarily practice-oriented clinicians; furthermore, clinicians may accept new neuroscience research more strongly in the abstract than for individual clients.

9,1095,4,"In a random sample of just over 300 medical doctors and consultants throughout Germany, various job-related variables were assessed together with sociodemographic data including time-related parameters work, and specific categories of accidents (moving vehicle and work-related). Occupational stress was related to number of weekly working hours, duration of the lunch-break, as well as age. Moving vehicle accidents were significantly correlated with the incidence of work related accidents during the last year. There was no evidence that medical doctors working longer weekly hours were more likely to be involved in a driving or work-related accident per se, but they did tend to report more accidents during house visits. Moving vehicle accidents were best predicted by the onset of working day as well as the number of dependent children (more children associated with less accidents). Furthermore, work-related accidents were significantly more frequent in larger communities and when surgeries were later in finishing. The implication of these findings are discussed.

It examines the impact of various personal and objective attributes of finance sector professionals on their risk choices derived from their portfolio allocation, and personal wealth data. Utilizing survey data from 206 professionals, we find that these professionals take higher risk in the form of investment in equities when investing in home country firms (geographic bias) and investing in firms headquartered in their home towns (home bias). Those relying on their own predictions when making investment decisions and those with emotional biases invest less in equities. Findings further show that younger professionals, professional with less education, with lower risk aversion, and with single broker accounts are more likely to invest in equities. We also find that those with higher expected returns invest more in equities, showing overconfidence. Subsample analysis results for finance professionals suggest that portfolio managers and brokerage company professionals display differing risk taking behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

9,1097,4,"It has recently been proposed that compulsive sexual behavior disorder should be included in the 11th version of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. Concerns have been repeatedly expressed regarding the overpathologizing of sexual behaviors and the potential for false-positive results in clinical practice. Empirical evidence indicates that stereotypes related to gender and sexual orientation might influence therapists’ assessments of clients. Those stereotypes are likely to be associated with different levels of pathologization and stigmatization of high levels of sexual interest and behavior. The aim of this study was to explore the possible connections between clients’ gender and sexual orientation and mental health professionals’ (MHP) pathologization of compulsive sexual behavior. A sample of MHPs (N = 546) were presented with a case vignette describing a client with compulsive sexual behavior. The information on the client varied by gender (male or female), sexual orientation (homosexual or heterosexual), and clinical condition (ambiguous diagnostic criteria and fulfilled compulsive sexual behavior disorder diagnostic criteria). After reading the vignette, the MHPs rated the client’s mental health status and gave an opinion about causation (psychological vs. biological etiology) and stigmatization indicators (blaming the affected individual for their problems, desire for social distance, perception of dangerousness). The MHPs showed significantly fewer tendencies to pathologize when the client was a homosexual woman or man independent of their clinical condition. Mediation analyses revealed that the biological etiological model partly mediated the effects of reduced pathologization in homosexual clients. These results indicate that clinical decisions relating to compulsive sexual behavior are influenced by nosologically irrelevant beliefs about the biological causation of sexual behavior.

A sample of 134 economists completed a self-report survey examining the decision process of different decision contexts in life, including pension decisions. Overall, participants showed low motivation to engage in the process of choosing a private pension plan, compared to their motivation to engage in other decision tasks. However, economists invested more in the decision process and showed greater satisfaction from their decision regarding their pension plan when they had a more positive perception of pensions.

9,1104,4,"Background Healthcare professionals' adherence to guidelines on child protection is not self-evident. This study assessed the effects of a computerised support tool on child healthcare professionals' adherence to the seven recommended guideline activities, and on time spent seeking information presented in this guideline. Methods A community-based intervention trial design was applied, comparing access to a paper-based guideline (control) with access to a paper-based guideline supplemented with a computerised guideline support tool (intervention). A total of 168 child healthcare doctors and nurses working in one large Dutch organisation were allocated to an intervention or control group. Outcomes were professionals' performance of seven recommended guideline activities and the amount of time spent seeking information presented in the guideline. Professionals' adherence was measured using two methods: health record analysis and a self-report questionnaire. The questionnaire was also used to collect data on the amount of time spent seeking guideline information. Results In total, 152 health records (102 in the intervention group and 50 in the control group) were available for analysis. The tool was registered in 14% of the records in the intervention group. Performance of activities, corrected for intentional non-adherence, was except for one activity, high (range 80-100%); no differences were found between the control and intervention groups. Forty-nine questionnaires (24 in the intervention group and 25 in the control group) were analysed. Sixty-three percent of the questionnaire respondents (15/24) claimed to have used the tool. No differences in guideline adherence were found between the two groups. Respondents in the intervention and control groups spent, on average, 115 and 153 min respectively seeking relevant information presented in the guideline. Conclusions The results regarding use of the tool were inconclusive as the outcomes differed per method. In contrast to expectations, performance of guideline activities was high in both groups.

,1110,1,"Background: Information distortion suggests that people change the evaluation of new information to support an emerging belief. The present study was designed to measure the extent to which physicians distort incoming medical information to support an emerging diagnosis. Design: Data were collected via an anonymous questionnaire. The experimental group (102 physicians) read 3 patient scenarios, each with 2 competing diagnoses. Physicians first read information that favored 1 of the 2 diagnoses (the ""steer""). They then rated a series of neutral cues that favored neither diagnosis. At each cue presentation, respondents rated the extent to which cues favored either diagnosis and updated the strength of their diagnostic belief. After the neutral cues in the third scenario, respondents rated cues that opposed the initial steer. A control group (36 physicians) rated all the cues in random order and not within scenarios, thus providing unbiased baseline ratings for calculating distortion in the experimental group. Results: Distortion was statistically significant ( P &lt; 0.001) and was associated with the strength of belief in the leading diagnosis. Physicians with over 10 years in practice distorted less than their less experienced counterparts ( x – = 1.04 v. x – = 1.78, P &lt; 0.05). Having developed an initial diagnostic leaning consistent with the steer, 56% of physicians remained committed to it after receiving the conflicting cues. Distortion was strongly associated with commitment to the steer (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.79; P = 0.03). Limitations: Physicians did not elicit information; therefore, the authors cannot estimate the size of distortion in tasks involving information search. Conclusions: Distortion could partly explain commitment of physicians to an early diagnosis.

9,1111,4,"Background: In a recent randomized controlled trial, providing UK family physicians with ‘early support’ (possible diagnoses to consider before any information gathering) was associated with diagnosing hypothetical patients on computer more accurately than control. Another group of physicians, who gathered information, gave a diagnosis, and subsequently received a list of possible diagnoses to consider (‘late support’), were no more accurate than control, despite being able to change their initial diagnoses. Objective: To replicate the UK study findings in another country with a different primary health care system. Methods: All study materials were translated into Greek. Greek family physicians were randomly allocated to one of three groups: control, early support and late support. Participants saw nine scenarios in random order. After reading some information about the patient and the reason for encounter, they requested more information to diagnose. The main outcome measure was diagnostic accuracy. Results: One hundred fifty Greek family physicians participated. The early support group was more accurate than control [odds ratio (OR): 1.67 (1.21–2.31)]. Like their UK counterparts, physicians in the late support group rarely changed their initial diagnoses after receiving support. The pooled OR for the early support versus control comparison from the meta-analysis of the UK and Greek data was 1.40 (1.13–1.67). Conclusion: Using the same methodology with a different sample of family physicians in a different country, we found that suggesting diagnoses to consider before physicians start gathering information was associated with more accurate diagnoses.

9,1112,4,"BACKGROUND: The discrepancy between the demand for and the supply of physician's services is the result of actions of multiple parties, including physicians. This situation raises ethical challenges for physicians, because it involves the profession's core values.OBJECTIVE: To discuss physicians' ethical obligations regarding the quantity of services that they might provide.METHOD: The obligations to accept new patients and to provide services to existing patients are deduced from the Code of Ethics of the Canadian Medical Association and The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. A model of physicians' ethics proposed by Pellegrino and Thomasma is examined as an example of a possible higher ethical standard.RESULTS: According to the Code of Ethics, physicians may refuse or accept new patients provided they do not discriminate improperly, and do not deny aid when there is ""urgent need."" It also states that the termination of medical services is permissible after ""adequate notice"" is given to the patient. The code states that physicians are to be guided by principles such as justice and compassion. Motivated by these principles, overworked physicians may accept new patients or delay the justifiable termination of services. Such action is praiseworthy as long as the physician can provide to all his or her patients the quantity and quality of care that meets professional standards. More altruistic ethical standards of practice than those in the Code of Ethics have been advocated.

Adopting this approach, a cluster analysis of data from a representative survey of 345 investors in Greece identified three main segments of investors: high profile investors (a high degree of overconfidence, risk tolerance, self-monitoring and social influence), moderate profile investors (a moderate level of overconfidence, risk tolerance, self-monitoring and social influence) and low profile investors (a low degree of overconfidence, risk tolerance, self-monitoring and social influence).

Design: Experimental with a repeated measures design. Methods: The study sample included 40 novice NPs. Data were collected from December 2003 to March 2004 following a stratified random assignment of the subjects to a textbook or PDA group. Participants identified appropriate laboratory value assessments, diagnosis, and medication decisions using the assigned resources when given two randomly administered clinical scenarios. Accuracy was determined by the correct response score to each clinical question. The completion of the scenario was timed by the investigator. Length of time necessary to answer each part of the scenario determined efficiency. Data analysis included mixed design repeated measures analysis of variance. Findings: There was a significant interaction and difference in accuracy in the laboratory analysis section of the case scenarios (F(1,38) = 21.256, p≤ .001) in the PDA group when compared with the textbook group. There were no differences in accuracy by section. In three of six efficiency variables measured, the PDA users were significantly more efficient.

9,1117,4,"External auditors typically gather audit evidence in a sequential fashion and revise their estimates of likelihood of material misstatements based on the evidence collected. Optimal utilization of audit evidence can help control audit risk and improve audit efficiency and effectiveness.This paper first shows how a typical audit risk assessment and belief revision task can be modeled using four theoretical models of belief revision. Then the descriptive properties of these models are evaluated based on the actual judgments of experienced auditors who assessed the likelihood of error in a task involving inventory valuation. A realistic audit case was administered to 101 experienced auditors. Models based on the following theories were evaluated: a version of Bayesian inference labeled Cascaded Inference Theory (Schum 1987; Schum and DuCharme 1971), two versions of the Belief Adjustment Model (Hogarth and Einhorn 1992), and a Version of the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Belief Functions (Srivastava and Shafer 1992; Shafer 1976).The experimental task involves belief revision after combining evidence about the reliability of a client's internal control system with substantive evidence relating to inventory pricing. Both the experimental and manipulation check results show that the auditors were sensitive to differences in the source reliability and diagnosticity of the manipulated audit evidence. The analytical results reveal that the four models differ in the way they interpret evidence relating to internal control system reliability and the manner in which such evidence is aggregated with price test evidence. Yet, all four models correctly predict the direction of auditor belief revision. The study reveals that important structural differences in the models result in differences in the magnitude, but not the direction of belief revision. This theoretical and empirical evidence has heretofore been unavailable in the literature. Further, the version of the Hogarth and Einhorn (1992) Belief Adjustment Model that views control systems reliability as negative evidence is the only model that captures both the direction and magnitude of auditors' belief revision. Finally, auditors' belief revision was lower than that predicted by the remaining three models, with the extent of discounting ranging from 31 percent to 40 percent.

9,1118,4,"Previous studies have demonstrated that fatigue impacts diagnostic accuracy, especially for those in training. We continued this line of investigation to determine if fatigue has any impact on a common source of errors - satisfaction of search (SOS). SOS requires subjects to participate in 2 sessions (SOS and non-SOS) and so does fatigue (fatigued and not fatigued) so we ran subjets in only the fatigued condition and used a previous non-fatigued study as the comparison. We used 64 chest computed radiographs half demonstrating various ""test'' abnormalities were read twice by 20 radiologists, once with and once without the addition of a simulated pulmonary nodule. Receiver-operating characteristic detection accuracy and decision thresholds were analyzed to study the effects of adding the nodule on detecting the test abnormalities. Adding nodules did not influence detection accuracy (ROC AUC SOS = 0.667; non-SOS = 0.679), but did induce a reluctance to report them. Adding nodules did not affect inspection time so the reluctance to report was not associated with reduced search. Fatigue did not appear to exacerbate the SOS effect. A second study with fractures revealed the same shift in performance but did reduce viewing times when fatigued. The results of these two studies suggest that the impact of fatigue on SOS is more complicated than expected and thus may require more investigation to fully understand its impact in the clinic.",Krupinski,2017,Does Fatigue Have Any Impact on Satisfaction of Search?,"MEDICAL IMAGING 2017: IMAGE PERCEPTION, OBSERVER PERFORMANCE, AND TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT",10136,,,Web of Science,"Krupinski, Elizabeth A.; Schartz, Kevin; Caldwell, Robert; Madsen, Mark; Berbaum, Kevin S."
9,1119,9,"Baseball umpires judge force-outs at first-base by comparing the sound of ball-mitt contact to the sight of foot-base contact. This study examines if distant observer judgments of the temporal order of visual versus auditory events are biased due to the slow speed of sound, or if judgments made from farther away systematically compensate for acoustic delays of sound. Seventy and 81 participants observed videos projected onto a gymnasium wall from 0, 100, or 200 feet, and made multisensory precedence judgments regarding which cue occurred first, visual (“safe”) or auditory (“out”). Experiment 1 used visual flash versus auditory click; Experiment 2, colliding visual stimuli versus auditory click; Experiment 3, films of base-runners with basemen catching balls. Our findings confirm a sight-audition farness effect (SAFE) bias such that when visual information is impoverished, distant observers making multisensory precedence judgments typically do not fully compensate for acoustic delays due to the slow speed of sound, which can lead to disagreements. In short, distant fans will tend to have more of a bias to experience baserunners as safe, compared with nearby umpires.

9,1122,4,"The aim of this study was to define a method for evaluating a player's decisions during a game based on the success probability of his actions and for analyzing the player strategy inferred from game actions. There were developed formal definitions of i) the stochastic process of player decisions in game situations and ii) the inference process of player strategy based on his game decisions. The method was applied to the context of soccer goalkeepers. A model of goalkeeper positioning, with geometric parameters and solutions to optimize his position based on the ball position and trajectory, was developed. The model was tested with a sample of 65 professional goalkeepers (28.8 ± 4.1 years old) playing for their national teams in 2010 and 2014 World Cups. The goalkeeper's decisions were compared to decisions from a large dataset of other goalkeepers, defining the probability of success in each game circumstance. There were assessed i) performance in a defined set of classes of game plays; ii) entropy of goalkeepers' decisions; and iii) the effect of goalkeepers' positioning updates on the outcome (save or goal). Goalkeepers' decisions were similar to the ones with the lowest probability of goal on the dataset. Goalkeepers' entropy varied between 24% and 71% of the maximum possible entropy. Positioning dynamics in the instants that preceded the shot indicated that, in goals and saves, goalkeepers optimized their position before the shot in 21.87% and 83.33% of the situations, respectively. These results validate a method to discriminate successful performance. In conclusion, this method enables a more precise assessment of a player's decision-making ability by consulting a representative dataset of equivalent actions to define the probability of his success. Therefore, it supports the evaluation of the player's decision separately from his technical skill execution, which overcomes the scientific challenge of discriminating the evaluation of a player's decision performance from the action result.

9,1123,9,"Background: Guided reflection interventions, in an effort to reduce diagnostic error, encourage diagnosticians to generate alternative diagnostic hypotheses and gather confirming and disconfirming evidence before making a final diagnosis. This method has been found to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy in recent studies; however, it requires a significant investment of time, and psychological theory suggests the possibility for unintended consequences owing to cognitive bias. This study compared a short and long version of a guided reflection task on improvements in diagnostic accuracy, change in diagnostic confidence, and rates of corrected diagnoses. Methods: One hundred and eighty-six fourth- and fifth-year medical students diagnosed a series of fictional clinical cases, by first impressions (control condition) or by using a short or long guided reflection process, and rated their confidence in their initial diagnostic hypothesis at intervals throughout the process. In the “short” condition, participants were asked to generate two alternatives to their initial diagnostic hypothesis; in the “long” condition, six alternatives were required. Results: The reflective intervention did not elicit more accurate final diagnoses than diagnosis based on first impressions only. Participants who completed a short version of the task performed similarly to those who completed a long version. Neither the short nor long form elicited significant changes in diagnostic confidence from the beginning to the end of the diagnostic process, nor did the conditions differ on the rate of corrected diagnoses. Conclusions: This study finds no evidence to support the use of the guided reflection method as a diagnostic aid for novice diagnosticians, who may already use an analytical approach to diagnosis and therefore derive less benefit from this intervention than their more experienced colleagues. The results indicate some support for a shorter, less demanding version of the process, and further study is now required to identify the most efficient process to recommend to doctors.

Purpose: To evaluate the extent to which medical students, medicine residents, and physicians are informed about key provisions of the MMA. Methods: Eighty-four attending physicians, 104 medicine residents, and 115 fourth-year medical students at the University of Pennsylvania were surveyed over a 2-week period in February-March 2004. The brief survey instrument consisted of 10 multiple choice questions: 9 questions assessing how well-informed respondents were about the MMA and 1 question assessing their knowledge of general current events. Results: Most respondents (77.8%) either ""strongly disagreed"" or ""disagreed"" that they were adequately informed about the MMA. While more than half of all respondents correctly answered the two questions about drug importation from Canada and general current events, a majority did not provide the correct answer to each of the other questions.

,1133,2,"Object. Deformational plagiocephaly (DP) is the leading cause of head shape abnormalities in infants. Treatment options include conservative measures and cranial molding. Pediatric neurosurgeons and craniofacial plastic surgeons have yet to agree on an ideal therapy, and no definable standards exist for initiating treatment with helmets. Furthermore, there may be differences between specialties in their perceptions of DP severity and need for helmet therapy.Methods. Requests to participate in a web-based questionnaire were sent to diplomates of the American Board of Pediatric Neurological Surgery and US and Canadian members of the Pediatric Joint Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons and the American Cleft Palate Craniofacial Association. Questions focused on educational background; practice setting; volume of DP patients; preferences for evaluation, treatment, follow-up; and incentives or deterrents to treat with helmet therapy. Six examples of varying degrees of DP were presented to delineate treatment preferences.Results. Requests were sent to 302 neurosurgeons and 470 plastic surgeons, and responses were received from 71 neurosurgeons (24%) and 64 plastic surgeons (14%). The following responses represented the greatest variations between specialties: 1) 8% of neurosurgeons and 26% of plastic surgeons strongly agreed with the statement that helmet therapy is more beneficial than conservative therapy (p < 0.01); and 2) 25% of neurosurgeons and 58% of plastic surgeons would treat moderate to severe DP with helmets (p < 0.01).Conclusions. Survey responses suggest that neurosurgeons are less likely to prescribe helmet therapy for DP than plastic surgeons.

9,1136,9,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to determine which patient-and tumor-related and clinical variables influence dedicated breast surgeons' and general surgeons' referrals for preoperative breast MRI for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS. Surgeons who perform breast surgery responded to a survey from June 16, 2014, through August 11, 2014. Participants self-identified as breast or general surgeons and provided professional practice details. They used Likert scores (range, 1-7 with increasing likelihood to order MRI) to weigh numerous patient-and tumor-related and clinical variables. Mean likelihood scores were calculated and compared using a linear mixed model. A p <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS. Two hundred eighty-nine surveys from 154 (53%) breast surgeons and 135 (47%) general surgeons showed an overall likelihood to refer for patients with a BRCA mutation (mean Likert score, 6.17), familial (mean Likert score, 5.33) or personal (mean Likert score, 5.10) breast cancer history, extremely dense breasts (mean Likert score, 5.30), age younger than 40 years (mean Likert score, 5.24), axillary nodal involvement (mean Likert score, 6.22), tumor that is mammographically occult (mean Likert score, 5.62) or fixed to the pectoralis (mean Likert score, 5.49), tumor that is a candidate for neoadjuvant treatment (mean Likert score, 5.38), multifocal or multicentric disease (mean Likert score, 5.22), invasive lobular carcinoma (mean Likert score, 5.20), T3 (mean Likert score, 4.48) or T2 (mean Likert score, 4.41) tumor, triple-negative breast cancer (mean Likert score, 4.66), a patient who is a candidate for mastectomy requesting breast conservation therapy (mean Likert score, 5.27), and radiologists' recommendations (mean Likert score, 5.19). Across all patient ages, breast surgeons referred more often than did general surgeons (mean Likert score, 4.32 vs 3.92; p = 0.03), especially for patients with BRCA mutation (mean Likert score, 6.39 vs 5.93; p = 0.01) and tumors smaller than 1 cm (mean Likert score, 3.84 vs 3.40; p = 0.002).

9,1139,1,"Background: E-learning and blended learning approaches gain more and more popularity in emergency medicine curricula. So far, little data is available on the impact of such approaches on procedural learning and skill acquisition and their comparison with traditional approaches. Objective: This study investigated the impact of a blended learning approach, including Web-based virtual patients (VPs) and standard pediatric basic life support (PBLS) training, on procedural knowledge, objective performance, and self-assessment. Methods: A total of 57 medical students were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 30) and a control group (n = 27). Both groups received paper handouts in preparation of simulation-based PBLS training. The intervention group additionally completed two Web-based VPs with embedded video clips. Measurements were taken at randomization (t0), after the preparation period (t1), and after hands-on training (t2). Clinical decision-making skills and procedural knowledge were assessed at t0 and t1. PBLS performance was scored regarding adherence to the correct algorithm, conformance to temporal demands, and the quality of procedural steps at t1 and t2. Participants’ self-assessments were recorded in all three measurements. Results: Procedural knowledge of the intervention group was significantly superior to that of the control group at t1. At t2, the intervention group showed significantly better adherence to the algorithm and temporal demands, and better procedural quality of PBLS in objective measures than did the control group. These aspects differed between the groups even at t1 (after VPs, prior to practical training). Self-assessments differed significantly only at t1 in favor of the intervention group.

Findings bolster the long‐standing concern about the technical nature of performance improvement, and practitioners are strongly encouraged to approach intervention selection as a decision, where their intervention preferences and beliefs of likely success are carefully adjudicated on the basis of the evidence they obtain. Future research with other types of performance improvement practitioners, replication studies, longitudinal, structural equation modeling, externally verifiable probabilities, and natural environments are recommended.

9,1143,4,"Objective: To describe how Italian clinicians disclose medical errors with clear and shared lines of responsibility.Methods: Thirty-eight volunteers were video-recorded in a simulated conversation while communicating a medical error to a simulated family member (SFM). They were assigned to a clear responsibility error scenario or a shared responsibility one. Simulations were coded for: mention of the term ""error"" and apology; communication content and affect using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. SFMs rated their willingness to have the patient continue care with the clinician.Results: Clinicians referred to an error and/or apologized in 55% of the simulations. The error was disclosed more frequently in the clear responsibility scenario (p < 0.02). When the ""error"" was explicitly mentioned, the SFM was more attentive, sad and anxious (p <= 0.05) and less willing to have the patient continue care (p < 0.05). Communication was more patient-centered (p < 0.05) and affectively dynamic with the SFMs showing greater anxiety, sadness, attentiveness and respectfulness in the clear responsibility scenario (p <0.05).Conclusions: Disclosing errors is not a common practice in Italy. Clinicians disclose less frequently when responsibility is shared and indicative of a system failure.Practice implications: Training programs to improve disclosure practice considering the type of error committed should be implemented.

9,1144,4,"Introduction. The ability to make good decisions is a critical component of pilot proficiency. Results of recent research suggest that aeronautical decision making (ADM) can be improved by training. The purposes of this research are to identify the best ADM mnemonic-based methods for training military pilots in decision making in tactical environments. Methods: There were 60 instructor pilots in the Republic of China Air Force Academy who evaluated the suitability of 5 different ADM methods including SHOR (Stimuli, Hypotheses, Options, Response); PASS (Problem identification, Acquire information, Survey strategy, Select strategy); FOR-DEC (Facts, Options, Risks & Benefits, Decision, Execution, Check); SOAR (Situation, Options, Act, Repeat); and DESIDE (Detect, Estimate, Set safety objectives, Identify, Do, Evaluate). Each was evaluated for six different types of decisions: go/no go; recognition-primed; response selection; resource management; nondiagnostic procedural; and creative problem-solving. Results: The instructor-pilots regarded the SHOR method as the best for time-limited and critical, urgent situations, while they preferred DESIDE for know[edge-based decisions that needed more comprehensive consideration and were less time limited. Discussion: To optimize training effectiveness, it is necessary to provide instruction based around both the SHOR and DESIDE decision-making mnemonic methods to provide comprehensive instruction for coping with all situations in the demanding military aviation environment.",Li,2005,Aeronautical decision making: Instructor-pilot evaluation of five mnemonic methods,AVIATION SPACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE,76,1156,1161,Web of Science,"Li, WC; Harris, D"
9,1145,4,"This paper advances the understanding of managerial voice endorsement based on a self‐regulation perspective. We suggest that although managers might potentially benefit more from employees' upward voice when they are more depleted, they are paradoxically less likely to diligently process or endorse such voice under ego depletion. We draw from ego depletion theory and argue that when managers are more depleted of their self‐control resources, they will spend less cognitive effort in processing voice. In turn, they tend to reject employee voice due to status quo bias and confirmation bias. We further suggest that the detrimental effect of ego depletion on voice endorsement is stronger when the voicing employee is perceived as having low expertise. We conducted an experience sampling study surveying 62 managers about voice events they encounter at work over 10 days (Study 1) and an experiment with 198 managers (Study 2).

9,1146,9,"Objective. Implicit prejudice and stereotyping may exist in health care providers automatically without their awareness. These biases can correlate with outcomes that are consequential for the patient. This study examined gynecologic oncology care providers' implicit prejudice and stereotyping toward cervical cancer.Methods. Members of professional gynecologic oncology organizations were asked to complete two Implicit Association Tests to determine if they implicitly associate cervical cancer with feelings of anger (prejudice) and beliefs about culpability for the disease (stereotypes), compared to ovarian cancer. Linear models and Student t-tests examined average levels of implicit bias and moderators of the implicit bias effects.Results. One-hundred seventy-six (132 female, 43 male, 1 nonresponse; (X) over bar (age) = 39.18 years, SDage = 10.58 years) providers were recruited and the final sample included 151 participants (93 physicians and 58 nurses, (X) over bar (age) = 38.93, SDage = 10.59). Gynecologic oncology providers showed significant levels of implicit prejudice, (X) over bar = 0.17, SD = 0.47, 95% CI: (0.10, 0.25), toward cervical cancer patients. They also showed significant levels of implicit stereotyping of cervical cancer patients, (X) over bar = 0.15, SD = 0.42, 95% CI: (0.08, 0.21). Whereas physicians did not demonstrate significant levels of implicit bias, nurses demonstrated greater levels of implicit prejudice and implicit stereotyping. Providers without cultural competency/implicit bias training demonstrated greater bias than those who had completed such training (p < .05).Conclusions. This study provides the first evidence that gynecologic oncology providers hold implicit biases related to cervical cancer. Interventions may be designed to target specific groups in gynecologic oncology to improve interactions with patients.

It also evaluates whether confirmation bias is reduced by changing the decision maker between arrest and prosecution. In Experiment 1, Swedish prosecutors (N = 40) assessed 8 scenarios where they either decided themselves or were informed about a colleague's decision to arrest or not arrest a suspect. Participants then rated how trustworthy the suspect's statement was as well as the strength of new ambiguous evidence and the total evidence. They also decided whether to prosecute and what additional investigative measures to undertake. In Experiment 2 the same method was used with Law and Psychology students (N = 60). Overall, prosecutors' assessments before the prosecution indicated that they were able to act as their own devil's advocate. Also, their assessments while deciding about whether to prosecute were reasonably balanced. However, after pressing charges, they displayed a more guilt-confirming mindset, suggesting they then took on the role as crime fighters.

,1150,2,"INTRODUCTION Plain abdominal radiographs commonly form a part of medical assessments. Most of these films are interpreted by the clinicians who order them. Interpretation of these films plays an important diagnostic role and therefore influences the decision for admission and subsequent management of these patients. The aim of this study was to find out how well doctors in different specialties and grades interpreted plain abdominal radiographs.MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 76 doctors from the Departments of Accident & Emergency, Medicine, Surgery and Radiology (17, 32, 23 and 4, respectively) participated in the study which involved giving a diagnosis for each of 14 plain abdominal radiographs (5 'normal' and 9 'abnormal'). They were also asked the upper limit of normal dimensions of small bowel and large bowel. One point was awarded for correctly identifying whether a radiograph was normal/abnormal, 1 point for the correct diagnosis and 1 point for the correct bowel dimensions, giving a total score of 30.RESULTS Mean scores out of 30 for specialties were as follows: Accident & Emergency 13.1 (range, 2-22), Medicine 11.2 (range 2-23). Surgery 15.0 (range, 8.24) and Radiology 17.0 (range, 14-20; P = 0.241). Mean scores out of 30 for different grades of doctors were as follows: pre-registration house officers 10.8 (range, 4-20), senior house officers 13.0 (range, 2-22), registrars/staff grades 13.8 (range, 2-23) and consultants 17.3 (range, 12-24; P = 0.028). Fifteen out of 76 (19.7 5) doctors correctly identified the upper limit of normal dimension of small bowel, 24 out of 76 (31.6%) correctly identified the upper limit of normal dimension of large bowel.DISCUSSION The level of seniority positively correlated with skills of plain abdominal radiograph interpretation. A large number of doctors were unable to give the correct upper limit of normal dimensions for small and large bowel.CONCLUSIONS All doctors could benefit from further training in the interpretation of plain abdominal radiographs. This could perhaps take place as formal teaching sessions and be included in induction programmes.

,1151,2,"Research suggests that people have difficulty estimating eyewitness accuracy. It is not known whether groups with professional experience of judging eyewitness memory are better at making such judgements than lay-persons. In the current study, police detectives, judges and lay-persons judged accuracy of responses to cued recall questions from ethnic in- and out-group witnesses who genuinely tried to remember a crime. Responses were presented in videotape or as transcripts. Detectives outperformed the other groups in discrimination accuracy, and participants performed better when statements were presented in transcribed than in videotaped format. Judges used a liberal response criterion overall, whereas detectives and lay-persons were more liberal when judging out-group than in-group witnesses. Findings indicate that there are observable cues to witnesses' accuracy, that specific professional groups have more knowledge of these cues than others, and that judgements of accuracy based on transcripts rather than live testimony would increase quality of legal decisions.

The results obtained demonstrate that home bias is a phenomenon that can be argued to exist in Italian occupational pension fund asset manager's asset allocation. The results of this research tend to show that when the asset manager is Italian, single or coacting, the choice falls on Italian asset classes. Finally, the home bias phenomenon could be considered an element for containing volatility in the prices of government securities, corporate bonds and equities because of the constant demand created on the market by the asset managers affected by this bias.

9,1161,9,"Exemplarity measurements of wines by at least 20 judges are used to estimate the degree of interjudge (dis)agreement and to tell wines apart into two contrasting extremes. Two sets of French red wines—Pinot noir from Burgundy and Cabernet franc from the Loire Valley—are studied separately but by the same approach. Short-listing criteria are used to collate 40 starting-price and middle-range wines for each set differing a priori in olfactory terms. Wine professionals assess their local wines first orthonasally and then, independently, by global evaluation. A pool of descriptive and inferential statistics indicates there is generally neither complete divergence nor real agreement among judges. For Burgundy Pinot noir, the weak agreement observed and measured for orthonasal evaluation strengthens slightly for global evaluation. Contrariwise, for Loire Valley Cabernet franc wines, agreement is poorer for global evaluation than for olfactory evaluation. With orthonasal evaluation, responses are more consistent for Cabernet franc than for Pinot noir, whereas for global evaluation, the levels of interjudge agreement are of the same order for both sets of wines. The subjectivity of sensory responses is interpreted for each situation. The personal judgment of exemplarity (or typicality) may therefore be defined as a demanding cognitive decision varying with the circumstances of the experiment and responding to a process of perceptual categorization based on previous knowledge and on an intuitive comparison between a sample and an abstract but conscious image of the category. Agreement among judges is sufficient to bipolarize the wines. As the power to discriminate among the wines is related to the level of interjudge agreement, bipolarization is most marked for the Cabernet franc wines evaluated by olfactory evaluation.

These findings illustrate just how difficult it is for all organizations to predict the future success of their apprentice-level employees. Even in an industry such as baseball—where employee output is easily measurable and highly quantifiable, and where the nature of the work at the developmental level is identical to that at the advanced level (i.e. pitching a baseball)—apprentice-level performance only provides modest insights into how that employee will ultimately perform at the advanced level.

Difficulties arise from the high prognostic uncertainty, the decisional incapacity of many children, the importance of the family, and conflicts with parents. The objectivity of judgments about medical indication has been questioned. Yet, little is known about the factors pediatricians actually include in their decisions.Aim: Our aims were to investigate which factors pediatricians apply in deciding about medical indication, and how they manage conflicts with parents.Design: We performed a qualitative focus group study with experienced pediatricians. The transcripts were subjected to qualitative content analysis.Setting/participants: We conducted three focus groups with pediatricians from different specialties caring for severely ill children/adolescents. They discussed life-sustaining treatment in two case scenarios that varied according to diagnosis, age, and gender.Results: The decisions about medical indication were based on considerations relating to the individual patient, to the family, and to other patients.

9,1166,9,"PURPOSE: This study seeks to determine how process and latent errors in the interpersonal, organizational, health system, and public health domains impact doctor/patient communication and patient safety.DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: There were 278 physicians from Manitoba, Canada who completed a self-report questionnaire during 2006. The largest specialty was family medicine, followed by internal medicine and pediatrics. Mean years of practice was 16, and 60 percent of the respondents were male. Respondents indicated the extent to which difficulties were encountered when communicating with patients.FINDINGS: The study finds that physicians had more difficulties with patients in the 0-20 year age bracket on 12 of the 18 communication statements. Psychiatry and pediatrics reported more difficulties with language interpreters. Pediatrics reported more difficulties with patients using culturally-based alternative medicine. Internal medicine had more difficulty with patients not appearing to trust or participate in treatment decisions. Patients in the 41-60 years age bracket had the highest mean for non-adherence to treatment plans, health maintenance and needed lifestyle change. The female physician-female patient dyad had fewer communication difficulties on all statements.RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Further research should examine how family structure influences health-care delivery and health outcomes. Health care organizations can contribute to improving quality of care by seeking out and correcting sources of latent errors, and by supporting professional development and practice interventions.ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Few studies exist that have linked communication difficulties to adverse events. This study provides insight on sources of interpersonal errors in communication that directly impact the physician/patient relationship and which may represent threats to patient safety.",Lovell,2012,Interpersonal factors affecting communication in clinical consultations: Canadian physicians' perspectives.,International journal of health care quality assurance,25,467,82,Web of Science,"Lovell, Brenda L; Lee, Raymond T; Brotheridge, Celeste M"
9,1167,4,"Multidimensional performance evaluation systems such as the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) were developed to overcome the documented tendency of managers to focus almost exclusively on short-term financial performance measures while disregarding or de-emphasising other short-term and/or long-term non-financial performance measures. Evidence suggests, however, that implementation of many of these systems has not achieved desired outcomes. Cogent communication of a corporation's goals and management's strategy to achieve those goals can be expected to influence employee 'buy-in' and the subsequent use or resistance to multidimensional performance measures. In this study we examine the role of strategy maps in communicating goals and strategy. We also examine individual differences (tolerance of ambiguity and functional background) that we believe also influence individuals to be more (or less) receptive to the guidance of strategy maps. An experiment was conducted with 165 experienced professionals enrolled in MBA programmes in Spain and the US. Our experimental results indicate that a strategy map reflecting integrated dependencies can de-bias evaluations of certain groups of individuals, who have high tolerance for ambiguity and have a financial work background.

Method: A randomized factorial survey of social workers working with adults with severe mental illness was employed. Eighty-seven social workers responded yielding 435 vignettes. Results: Hypotheses were partially supported. Diagnosis, symptomology, threats of harm, treatment adherence, substance use, and social workers’ values and experience predicted support for autonomy and willingness to engage in SDM. Willingness to engage in SDM was modestly mediated by support for autonomy.

Methods: Factorial experiment of 128 generalist physicians using identical clinically authentic videotaped vignettes depicting patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or depression. Results: For CHD, physicians were least certain for Black patients ( p = .003) and for younger female patients ( p = .013). For depression, average certainty was higher than for the CHD presentation (74.0 vs. 57.9 on of scale of 0–100, p &lt; .001) and there were no main effects of patient or provider characteristics. Increasing diagnostic certainty was a significant predictor of subsequent clinical actions, and these varied according to physician and patient characteristics across both conditions. Conclusions: Physicians were least certain of their CHD diagnoses for Black patients and for younger women, but patient characteristics alone did not affect physician certainty of depression diagnoses. Physicians responded differentially to diagnostic certainty in terms of their clinical therapeutic actions such as test ordering and writing prescriptions. Physician responses to certainty may be as important as their responses to patient characteristics for understanding variation in clinical decision-making.

Using data from a vignette-based factorial experiment of 256 primary care providers, we examine the cognitive basis of disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD). We explore whether previously observed disparities are due to physicians (1) not fully considering CHD for certain patients or (2) considering CHD but then discounting it. Half of the physicians in the experiment were primed with explicit directions to consider a CHD diagnosis, and half were not. Relative to their unprimed counterparts, primed physicians were more likely to order CHD-related tests and prescriptions. However, the main effects for patient gender and age remained, suggesting that physicians treated these demographic variables as diagnostic features indicating lower risk of CHD for these patients. This finding suggests that physician appeals to perceived base rates have the potential to contribute to the further reification of socially constructed health statistics.

Theoretical Acoustics pp. 175-191]. The three groups were professional percussionists, nonmusicians, and individuals recruited from the general population without regard to musical background. In the two-interval, forced-choice procedure, listeners chose the sound corresponding to the greater force of impact as the length of the bar varied from one presentation to the next. From the equations of motion, a maximum-likelihood test for the task was determined to be of the form Delta log A + alpha Delta log f > 0, where A and f are the amplitude and frequency of any one partial and alpha = 0.5. Relative decision weights on Delta log f were obtained from the trial-by-trial responses of listeners and compared to alpha. Percussionists generally outperformed the other groups; however, the obtained decision weights of all listeners deviated significantly from alpha and showed variability within groups far in excess of the variability associated with replication.

This represents a substantial and unnecessary cost, given that it is possible to delegate a range of tasks to dental care professionals, who are a less expensive resource.

9,1187,4,"Background and Purpose: Whistleblowing in the nursing profession is a complex dilemma. If nurses decide to do nothing to stop a colleague's or management's harmful conduct, they may be violating their basic professional commitment to promote and protect patients' health. Whistleblowing is also complex given that the act might have negative consequences for the whistleblower as well as the wrong doer. This study aims to answer three questions, and suggests some lines for further research on this topic as well as ways for integrating it in the nursing curriculum: Are nursing students willing to take action to stop misconduct in order to protect a patient's interest? Are they willing to report the misconduct to authorities within an organization and/or outside of it? Are they willing to report a colleague's wrongdoing as well as that of a manager?Subject and Methods: Eighty two nursing students in Israel were presented with a questionnaire containing two vignettes, and required to make a decision that involved whistleblowing. One vignette described a case of misconduct of a colleague, and the other a misconduct of a manager.Results: The findings indicate that the students considered acts that are detrimental to the patient to be very serious. The participants gave high and similar scores to their own willingness to take action to change the situation for both vignettes. The score of the internal index was found to be significantly higher than the external index.Discussion: The participants' desire to correct a colleague's or superior's misconduct was coupled with a progressive retraction as the circle of disclosure widened. The retraction may reflect the respondents' concerns that external exposure could have negative consequences for the wrong-doer, the healthcare organization and/or the individuals who receive its services.

Doctor factors explained only 2.0%. The vast majority of the explained variance in diabetes diagnosis was due to organizational factors (14.3%). Relative contributions combined (patient, provider, organizational factors) explained only 20% of the total variance. Conclusion: Attempts to reduce health care variations usually focus on the education/activation of patients, or increased training of doctors. Our findings suggest that shifting quality improvement efforts to the area which contributes most to the creation and amplification of variations (organizational influences) may produce better results in terms of reduced variations in health care associated with diabetes.

9,1191,4,"Conducted a pilot study with 9 physicians in a model Family Practice Unit. It was hypothesized that decisions regarding treatment priorities would lead to the ""undertreatment"" of ailments for which the physicians felt relatively ineffective and that feelings of efficacy would be greater for primarily organic than for primarily psychological ailments. Physician interviews and examination of the Unit's diagnostic file provided the data for the study. A treatment bias as a function of the degree to which an ailment had a psychological component was not demonstrated. However, the physicians did feel less effective (less comfortable) in treating problems that were significantly psychological and also felt that methods of intervention for such ailments were less clear-cut. Physician comfort level was greater when there were few alternative treatment methods generally used for the ailment and when the ailment was recorded frequently. A suggestion is made that medical curricula include more practical experience in treating ailments which have notable psychological components in order to increase physician comfort and probably physician effectiveness.

9,1196,9,"Background In many professions, nontechnical aspects such as motivation or coping with stress are known to influence performance, success, and outcome. These qualities are assessed and trained in novices for quality and safety reasons. This study explored the impact of self-belief of surgeons on laparoscopic performance using a virtual reality simulator (LapSim (R)).Methods Eighteen inexperienced surgical residents (with less than ten laparoscopic procedures performed) and 22 advanced residents (with more than 50 laparoscopic procedures performed) filled out a ten-item questionnaire used for the assessment of the individual sense of general self-efficacy (GSE). Afterward the participants were asked to perform three defined tasks on the LapSim, each at two different levels of difficulty. The tasks consisted of coordination, dissection, and application of clips. To assess laparoscopic performance, the total time to complete the tasks, economy of motion, and damage parameters were analyzed and correlated with the GSE score by means of Bravis-Pearson correlation analysis.Results In novices, high GSE scores correlated with more errors and poor economy of motion, while in advanced residents, laparoscopic performance was independent of the level of assessed self-efficacy.Conclusion In a small sample, high self-belief does not predict success. In novices it negatively correlates with laparoscopic skills, while in advanced residents it is independent of laparoscopic performance. Thus, training aspects seem to be of greater importance for laparoscopic skills.

9,1197,4,"Background: Previous studies have documented the underdiagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) in women, but less is known about which alternate diagnoses take precedence and whether additional patient factors modify possible gender bias. Objective: To measure gender variation in clinical decision making, including (1) the number, types, and certainty levels of diagnoses considered and (2) how diagnoses vary according to patient characteristics, when patients have identical symptoms of CHD. Methods: This was a factorial experiment presenting videotaped CHD symptoms, systematically altering patient gender, age, socioeconomic status (SES) and race, and physician gender and level of experience. The primary end point was physicians’ most certain diagnosis. Results: Physicians ( n = 128) mentioned five diagnoses on average, most commonly heart, gastrointestinal, and mental health conditions. Physicians were significantly less certain of the underlying cause of symptoms among female patients regardless of age ( p = 0.006), but only among middle-aged women were they significantly less certain of the CHD diagnosis ( p &lt; 0.001). Among middle-aged women, 31.3% received a mental health condition as the most certain diagnosis, compared with 15.6% of their male counterparts ( p = 0.03). An interaction effect showed that females with high SES were most likely to receive a mental health diagnosis as the most certain ( p = 0.006). Conclusions: Middle-aged female patients were diagnosed with the least confidence, whether for CHD or non-CHD conditions, indicating that their gender and age combination misled physicians, particularly toward mental health alternative diagnoses.

,1199,1,"Background and Purpose: Despite the frequency at which urologists endoscopically estimate lesion size, their accuracy has not been established. Our objectives were to determine the accuracy of cystoscopic and ureteroscopic estimates of lesion size using in vitro models of the urinary tract and to assess potential impacting factors. Methods: Eleven staff urologists and 9 urology learners performed cystoscopy on a series of pig bladders containing mock papillary and flat lesions. Each provided three sets of size estimates: two using only the cystoscope to assess intraobserver agreement and the third with the aid of a ureteral catheter as a visual reference. Similar estimates were made with a flexible ureteroscope on papillary lesions within an inorganic upper urinary tract model. Differences in mean estimates and the agreement between repeated estimates were assessed. Results: The level of endoscopic training did not influence the mean error of estimation (MEE) for either cystoscopy or ureteroscopy regardless of lesion size and appearance. Staff and learners consistently underestimated lesion size with median errors of 34% and 43%, with excellent (median intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] of 0.97) and fair (median ICC of 0.56) reproducibility for cystoscopy and ureteroscopy, respectively. Use of the visual reference during cystoscopy did not improve the MEE. Conclusions: Urologists, regardless of their level of training, substantially underestimate lesion size by 34% to 43%.

9,1201,9,"Fast-moving sports such as tennis require both players and match officials to make rapid accurate perceptual decisions about dynamic events in the visual world. Disagreements arise regularly, leading to disputes about decisions such as line calls. A number of factors must contribute to these disputes, including lapses in concentration, bias and gamesmanship. Fundamental uncertainty or variability in the sensory information supporting decisions must also play a role. Modern technological innovations now provide detailed and accurate physical information that can be compared against the decisions of players and officials. The present paper uses this psychophysical data to assess the significance of perceptual limitations as a contributor to real-world decisions in professional tennis. A detailed analysis is presented of a large body of data on line-call challenges in professional tennis tournaments over the last 2 years. Results reveal that the vast majority of challenges can be explained in a direct highly predictable manner by a simple model of uncertainty in perceptual information processing. Both players and line judges are remarkably accurate at judging ball bounce position, with a positional uncertainty of less than 40 mm. Line judges are more reliable than players. Judgements are more difficult for balls bouncing near base and service lines than those bouncing near side and centre lines.

The research also investigated the moderating effects of individual differences (experience with carpal tunnel syndrome, experience with layoffs, ability to read others’ emotions, and intrinsic motivation orientation [IMO]) on the relation between the MOC and the ethical decision-making elements for each type of harm. Using a sample of 185 Chinese professionals, a between-subjects, fully crossed experimental scenario design revealed that physical and economic job-related harm were recognized as moral issues to a greater extent than cognitive or emotional harm. Second, physical job-related harm stimulated a higher level of moral evaluations than economic and cognitive harm. Third, individuals intended to act ethically when MOC was high versus low. Finally, experience with layoffs and IMO helped explain the relations between MOC and moral evaluations for economic and cognitive job-related harm, respectively.

9,1203,4,"Objectives: Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of an outcome bias in medical decision making, which can be represented by a tendency to overweight outcome information when evaluating the quality of a decision. This study investigates whether the outcome of a previous decision on a medical case affects a later decision on a similar case. Methods: Thirty-six practising doctors and 36 nurses were presented with two superficially different but structurally identical dichotomous diagnostic problems, at intervals of about 6 weeks. The first problem was followed by the delivery of information about the outcome that could be either positive or negative. Results: Of the doctors, 39% of those who received information indicating an adverse outcome in the first case modified their diagnosis in the second case, whereas none of the doctors who were given information indicating a positive outcome made an alternative diagnosis. Of the nurses, 22% of those given information of a positive outcome and 56% of those given information of a negative outcome in the first case made an alternative decision in the second case. Conclusions: The results show that the outcome of a previous single case can be overweighted in the process of making a later decision about a similar case, to the point that information on outcome alone can modify a decision that the health provider originally thought to be optimal, according to his or her experience and the available evidence. Hence, outcome bias not only affects the evaluation of a decision, but can also affect learning by modifying later decisions.

Clinical judgments included evaluations of adaptive functioning, long-term prognostic assessments, short-term risk evaluations, and treatment recommendations. Analyses included intraclass correlations between clinicians to assess reliability, as well as an examination of the variance of clinical judgments as a function of the identified gender of the case and the gender of the participating clinician. No significant two-way interactions were found between case gender and clinician gender in predicting the clinical judgments. A significant main effect of case gender in predicting vocational functioning was observed, such that female cases were rated as having better estimated vocational functioning than male cases. In addition, a significant main effect of clinician gender in predicting aggression and violence risk was found, such that ratings by female clinicians were higher than ratings by male clinicians.

This finding supports regulators' and prior researchers' calls for additional guidance to assist auditors in forming expectations that consider the nature of the account. We also find that auditors judge the level of assurance from analytical procedures consistent with their precision assessments. However, in contrast to guidance specified in professional standards, we find that auditors do not always incorporate their precision assessments into judgments about the range of possible differences between expected and recorded amounts, nor the likelihood of misstatement causes.

9,1211,4,"Rationale, aims and objectives: Decades of work on health disparities have culminated in identification of three contributors to variability in diagnosis and management of disease: (i) patient attributes; (ii) doctor’s characteristics; and (iii) organizational factors. Understanding the relative influence of different contributors to variability in diagnosis and management of diabetes is important to improving quality and reducing disparities. This study was designed to examine the influence of patient, provider and organizational factors on the diagnosis and management of a major chronic disease—diabetes. Method: A factorial experiment using video vignettes was conducted among n = 192 primary care doctors. Doctors were interviewed after viewing vignettes of (1) a ‘patient’ with symptoms strongly suggestive of diabetes and (2) an already diagnosed diabetes ‘patient’ with emerging peripheral neuropathy. Results: A total of 60.9% of doctors identified diabetes as the correct diagnosis, with significant variations depending on the patients’ race/ethnicity. Many doctors offered competing diagnoses with high levels of certainty. For the ‘patient’ with emerging peripheral neuropathy, 42.2% of doctors would do all essential components of a foot examination, while 21.9% would do none. Conclusions: That half of all diabetes in the United States remains undiagnosed is unsurprising given only 60.9% of doctors would diagnose it when the condition is strongly suggested, and nearly one-quarter suspecting diabetes would not order tests necessary to confirm it. The diagnosis of diabetes is significantly influenced by a patient’s race/ethnicity, and clinical management (specifically for foot neuropathy) is influenced by patient socioeconomic status (SES), doctor’s gender and access to clinical guidelines.

9,1212,4,"ContextMedical students can have difficulty in distinguishing left from right. Many infamous medical errors have occurred when a procedure has been performed on the wrong side, such as in the removal of the wrong kidney. Clinicians encounter many distractions during their work. There is limited information on how these affect performance.ObjectivesUsing a neuropsychological paradigm, we aim to elucidate the impacts of different types of distraction on left-right (LR) discrimination ability.MethodsMedical students were recruited to a study with four arms: (i) control arm (no distraction); (ii) auditory distraction arm (continuous ambient ward noise); (iii) cognitive distraction arm (interruptions with clinical cognitive tasks), and (iv) auditory and cognitive distraction arm. Participants' LR discrimination ability was measured using the validated Bergen Left-Right Discrimination Test (BLRDT). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyse the impacts of the different forms of distraction on participants' performance on the BLRDT. Additional analyses looked at effects of demographics on performance and correlated participants' self-perceived LR discrimination ability and their actual performance.ResultsA total of 234 students were recruited. Cognitive distraction had a greater negative impact on BLRDT performance than auditory distraction. Combined auditory and cognitive distraction had a negative impact on performance, but only in the most difficult LR task was this negative impact found to be significantly greater than that of cognitive distraction alone. There was a significant medium-sized correlation between perceived LR discrimination ability and actual overall BLRDT performance.ConclusionsDistraction has a significant impact on performance and multifaceted approaches are required to reduce LR errors. Educationally, greater emphasis on the linking of theory and clinical application is required to support patient safety and human factor training in medical school curricula.

One hundred ten physicians and 44 nurses estimated the probability of physical assault of 478 patients admitted to a short-term locked psychiatric inpatient unit. The level of assessed risk showed a substantial correspondence with the likelihood of later violence when the physician and nurse ratings were highly concordant.

A total of 2844 surveys were mailed with 2 follow-up mailings at 6-week intervals; 761 surveys were returned for a response rate of 26.8%. The majority of respondents were white men, Protestant, and served in rural areas.Interventions: None.Main Outcome Measures: On the basis of 4 case scenarios, (1) professional behavior as determined by respondents' willingness to prosecute and what criminal charges they would seek; and (2) personal beliefs as determined by whether prosecutors believed the physicians' actions were morally wrong and whether they would want the same action taken if they were in the patient's condition.Results: Most respondents would not seek prosecution in 3 of the 4 cases. In the fourth case, involving physician-assisted suicide, only about one third of the respondents said that they definitely would prosecute. Those who would prosecute would most often seek a charge of criminal homicide. A majority of respondents believed that the physicians' actions were morally correct in each of the 4 cases and would want the same action taken if they were in the patient's position. There was a strong correlation between personal beliefs and professional behaviors.Conclusions: A large majority of responding prosecutors were unwilling to prosecute physicians in cases that clearly fall within currently accepted legal and professional boundaries.

The results of these experiments provide evidence for a positive influence of high cognitive diversity for debiasing judgment while similarly indicating no such effect for groups with low cognitive diversity. These findings suggest that group composition aspects can play an important role for improving judgment in decision making teams and open promising new avenues for studying debiasing in behavioral strategy research.

9,1219,9,"Purpose: The aim of this paper is to present the necessity for practical wisdom in the managerial decision making process and its role in such a process. The paper seeks to contrast the position with two conventional approaches based on maximizing and satisficing behaviors respectively. Design/methodology/approach: Following Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas it is argued that a correct decision should consider an “integral rationality” which includes not only “instrumental rationality” but also “practical rationality”. The latter permits the evaluation of both means and ends from the perspective of human good. Practical wisdom helps the decision maker to determine how a decision will contribute to the human good in each particular situation. Findings: Maximizing and satisficing behaviors are based on the facts-values dichotomy, which separates business and ethics and presents a rationalistic and incomplete view of the reality. The alternative presented here sees the decision as a whole, and this is a more comprehensive understanding of the reality. Ethics is better integrated into the decision making process, since it is an intrinsic part of such a process, not an extrinsic addition. Practical implications: Every decision has an ethical dimension, which should be considered by managers for making good decisions. Practical wisdom is essential in perceiving such a dimension and in making sound moral judgments in the making of decisions. Managers do not need only skills for making correct decisions, but practical wisdom and moral virtues, too. Originality/value: The approach presented in the paper defeats the conventional but narrow views of managerial decision making based on maximizing behavior or on satisficing behavior and introduces the categories of good and evil as the main driver for managerial decision making.

The author performed this study to determine how image-based elements are translated into decisions by radiologists with different levels of experience in the reading of mammograms.Materials and Methods. Three full-time mammographers and four radiology residents read 40 two-view mammogram cases. The observers' eye position was tracked while they searched the mammograms for malignancies. Spatial frequency analysis was performed to relate what the observers reported with where they looked.Results. Statistically significant differences were found between lesion-containing areas that attracted visual attention and were correctly interpreted and those that were visually inspected but not reported. In addition, an artificial neural network was successfully trained to map the image characteristics in the visually selected areas on a mammogram and to link them to a likely decision by the observer.Conclusion.

9,1222,9,"The pain of Black Americans is systematically underdiagnosed and undertreated, compared to the pain of their White counterparts. Extensive research has examined the psychological factors that might account for such biases, including status judgments, racial prejudice, and stereotypes about biological differences between Blacks and Whites. Across seven experiments, we accumulated evidence that lower-level perceptual processes also uniquely contribute to downstream racial biases in pain recognition. We repeatedly observed that White participants showed more stringent thresholds for perceiving pain on Black faces, compared to White faces. A tendency to see painful expressions on Black faces less readily arose, in part, from a disruption in configural processing associated with other-race faces. Subsequent analyses revealed that this racial bias in pain perception could not be easily attributed to stimulus features (e.g., color, luminance, or contrast), subjective evaluations related to pain tolerance and experience (e.g., masculinity, dominance, etc.), or objective differences in face structure and expression intensity between Black and White faces. Finally, we observed that racial biases in perception facilitated biases in pain treatment decisions, and that this relationship existed over and above biased judgments of status and strength, explicit racial bias, and endorsement of false beliefs regarding biological differences. A meta-analysis across 9 total experiments (N = 1,289) confirmed the robustness and size of these effects. This research establishes a subtle, albeit influential, perceptual pathway to intergroup bias in pain care and treatment. Implications for racial bias, face perception, and medical treatment are discussed.

Pediatric medical professionals within an urban medical campus were provided with five case vignettes in relation to different diseases. Medical professionals rated the severity of family noncompliance with follow-up services and indicated whether they would report suspected medical neglect to Child Protective Services (CPS). Physicians were more likely to report medical neglect than the other mandated reporters in the study. Logistic regression analyses found that medical professionals’ perceptions of the severity of family noncompliance with services were significantly predictive of decisions to report medical neglect. Respondent gender and the method by which families were notified of screening results also significantly affected reporting behaviors in certain instances. Although all vignettes included information that met legal statutes for reporting neglect, medical professionals indicated that they would only report neglect 40–61% of the time across vignettes.

We evaluated if a mobile application improves generalist physicians' appropriate laboratory test ordering and diagnosis decisions and assessed if physicians perceive it as useful for learning.Methods: In an experimental, vignette study, physicians diagnosed 8 patient vignettes with normal prothrombin times (PT) and abnormal partial thromboplastin times (PTT). Physicians made test ordering and diagnosis decisions for 4 vignettes using each resource: a mobile app, PTT Advisor, developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Clinical Laboratory Integration into Healthcare Collaborative (CLIHC); and usual clinical decision support. Then, physicians answered questions regarding their perceptions of the app's usefulness for diagnostic decision making and learning using a modified Kirkpatrick Training Evaluation Framework.Results: Data from 368 vignettes solved by 46 physicians at 7 US health care institutions show advantages for using PTT Advisor over usual clinical decision support on test ordering and diagnostic decision accuracy (82.6 vs 70.2% correct; P<.001), confidence in decisions (7.5 vs 6.3 out of 10; P<.001), and vignette completion time (3:02 vs 3:53 min.; P =.06).

9,1231,4,"Background: Living wills accompany patients who present for emergent care. To the best of our knowledge, no studies assess pre-hospital provider interpretations of these instructions. Objectives: Determine how a living will is interpreted and assess how interpretation impacts lifesaving care. Design setting: Three-part survey administered at a regional emergency medical system educational symposium to 150 emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. Part I assessed understanding of the living will and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders. Part II assessed the living will's impact in clinical situations of patients requiring lifesaving interventions. Part III was similar to part 11 except a code status designation (full code) was incorporated into the living will. Results: There were 127 surveys completed, yielding an 87% response rate. The majority were mule (55%) and EMTs (74%). The average age was 44 years and the average duration of employment was 15 years. Ninety percent (95% confidence interval [CI] 84.6-95.4%) of respondents determined that, after review of the living will, the patient's code status was DNR, and 92% (95% CI 86.5-96.6%) defined their understanding of DNR as comfort care/end-of-life care. When the living will was applied to clinical situations, it resulted in a higher proportion of patients being classified as DNR as opposed to full code (Case A 78% [95% CI 71.2-85.6%] vs. 22% [95% Cl 14.4-28.8%], respectively; Case B 67% [95% CI 58.4-74.9%] vs. 33% [95% CI 25.1-1.6%], respectively; Case C 63% [95% Cl 55.1-71.9%] vs. 37% 195% CI 28.1-44.9%]), respectively. With the scenarios presented, this DNR classification resulted in a lack of or a delay in lifesaving interventions. Incorporating a code status into the living will produced statistically significant increases in the provision of lifesaving care. In Case A, intubation increased from 15% to 56% (p < 0.0001); Case B, defibrillation increased from 40% to 59% (p < 0.0001); and Case C, defibrillation increased from 36% to 65% (p < 0.0001).

,1232,2,"Background: Concern exists that living wills are misinterpreted and may result in compromised patient safety. Objective: To determine whether adding code status to a living will improves understanding and treatment decisions. Methods: An Internet survey was conducted of General Surgery, and Family, Internal, and Emergency Medicine residencies between May and December 2009. The survey posed a fictitious living will with and without additional clarification in the form of code status. An emergent patient care scenario was then presented that included medical history and signs/symptoms. Respondents were asked to assign a code status and choose appropriate intervention. Questions were formatted as dichotomous responses. Correct response rate was based on legal statute. Significance of changes in response due to the addition of either clinical context (past medical history/signs/symptoms) or code status was assessed by contingency table analysis. Results: Seven hundred sixty-eight faculty and residents at accredited training centers in 34 states responded. At baseline, 22% denoted ""full code"" as the code status for a typical living will, and 36% equated ""full care"" with a code status DNR. Adding clinical context improved correct responses by 21%. Specifying code status further improved correct interpretation by 28% to 34%. Treatment decisions were either improved 12-17% by adding code status (""Full Code,"" ""Hospice Care"") or worsened 22% (""DNR"").

9,1234,4,"Introduction: Living wills are a form of advance directives that help to protect patient autonomy. They are frequently encountered in the conduct of medicine. Because of their impact on care, it is important to understand the adequacy of current medical school training in the preparation of physicians to interpret these directives.Methods: Between April and August 2011 of third and fourth year medical students participated in an internet survey involving the interpretation of living wills. The survey presented a standard living will as a ""stand-alone,'' a standard living will with the addition an emergent clinical scenario and then variations of the standard living will that included a code status designation (""DNR,'' ""Full Code,'' or ""Comfort Care''). For each version/scenario, respondents were asked to assign a code status and choose interventions based on the cases presented.Results: Four hundred twenty-five students from medical schools throughout the country responded. The majority indicated they had received some form of advance directive training and understood the concept of code status and the term ""DNR.'' Based on a stand-alone document, 15% of respondents correctly denoted ""full code'' as the appropriate code status; adding a clinical scenario yielded negligible improvement. When a code designation was added to the living will, correct code status responses ranged from 68% to 93%, whereas correct treatment decisions ranged from 18% to 78%. Previous training in advance directives had no impact on these results.Conclusion: Our data indicate that the majority of students failed to understand the key elements of a living will; adding a code status designations improved correct responses with the exception of the term DNR.

However, more than 70% of medical errors are attributable to dysfunctional team dynamics. The recent suggestion that health care teams are more complex than nonmedical teams suggests that we require more sophisticated knowledge of team dynamics and processes.Purposes: The mechanisms of dysfunctional interprofessional teams focusing on affective, behavioral, and cognitive effects are explored. We argue that interprofessional composition impacts team dynamics by increasing the likelihood of affective conflict, which mediates a decrease in elaborative behaviors and open-mindedness.Methodology: The hypotheses are investigated using a cross-sectional, correlational design. Survey data received from 218 members of 47 interprofessional teams employed in an acute care setting, representing a 39% response rate, is used to investigate two moderated mediation pathways.Findings: Analysis supports a significant relationship between interprofessional composition and affective conflict but only when team rate highly for professional identification. Results also support a dual moderated mediation pathway through which professional diversity has a dysfunctional effect on debate and open-mindedness.Practice Implications: A range of strategies emerge from the findings to minimize dysfunctional interprofessional team dynamics. These include the use of leadership strategies, such as transformational styles, reinforcement of shared values such as patient-centeredness, and development of a shared group identity.",Mitchell,2014,"The ABC of health care team dynamics: Understanding complex affective, behavioral, and cognitive dynamics in interprofessional teams",HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT REVIEW,39,1,9,Web of Science,"Mitchell, Rebecca; Parker, Vicki; Giles, Michelle; Boyle, Brendan"
9,1236,4,"Clinicians have strong opinions about whether they should be provided the clinical history before or after bedside testing. We hypothesized that diagnostic accuracy is improved when a concordant clinical history is provided before a diagnostic test. To investigate whether the timing (before or after) and the consistency (concordant vs discordant) of the clinical history in the setting of focused bedside echocardiography affects clinician diagnostic accuracy and management decisions. Thirty-two cardiology residents were asked to perform a bedside echocardiogram on a Vimedix 3D mannequin. Half of the histories were provided before echocardiography and half after echocardiography. Half were consistent with the echocardiographic diagnosis (concordant), and half were suggestive of a plausible alternative diagnosis (discordant). Participants were asked for a diagnosis and management plan. The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the echocardiographic images. The secondary outcome was the management plan. Overall diagnostic accuracy was 63%. If the clinical history was provided before the bedside testing, it significantly improved diagnostic accuracy if it was concordant and it diminished accuracy if it was discordant (odds ratio [OR], 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.80; P = 0.001). Clinical history, whether concordant or discordant, had no significant impact if provided after the images were obtained. Appropriate management was chosen 77% of the time and was chosen less often with discordant compared with concordant histories (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.57; P = 0.001).

,1237,2,"Objective: To investigate the impact of time pressure (TP) on prefrontal activation and technical performance in surgical residents during a laparoscopic suturing task.Background: Neural mechanisms enabling surgeons to maintain performance and cope with operative stressors are unclear. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated due to its role in attention, concentration, and performance monitoring.Methods: A total of 33 residents [Postgraduate Year (PGY)1-2 = 15, PGY3-4 = 8, and PGY5 = 10] performed a laparoscopic suturing task under ""self-paced"" (SP) and ""TP"" conditions (TP = maximum 2 minutes per knot). Subjective workload was quantified using the Surgical Task Load Index. PFC activation was inferred using optical neuroimaging. Technical skill was assessed using progression scores (au), error scores (mm), leak volumes (mL), and knot tensile strengths (N).Results: TP led to greater perceived workload amongst all residents (mean Surgical Task Load Index score + SD: PGY1-2: SP = 160.3 +/- 24.8 vs TP = 202.1 + 45.4, P < 0.001; PGY3-4: SP = 123.0 + 52.0 vs TP = 172.5 + 43.1, P < 0.01; PGY5: SP = 105.8 + 55.3 vs TP =159.1 + 63.1, P < 0.05). Amongst PGY1 -2 and PGY3 -4, deterioration in task progression, error scores and knot tensile strength (P < 0.05), and diminished PFC activation was observed under TP. In PGY5, TP resulted in inferior task progression and error scores (P < 0.05), but preservation of knot tensile strength. Furthermore, PGY5 exhibited less attenuation of PFC activation under TP, and greater activation than either PGY1-2 or PGY3-4 under both experimental conditions (P < 0.05).Conclusions: Senior residents cope better with temporal demands and exhibit greater technical performance stability under pressure, possibly due to sustained PFC activation and greater task engagement.

Behavioral psychology uses scientific methods to analyze the influence of social, cognitive, and emotional factors on decisions. The overarching hypothesis underlying this ""thought outside the box"" is that the application of behavioral psychology to physician decision making in the intensive care unit will demonstrate the existence of cognitive biases associated with classic intensive care unit decisions; provide insight into novel strategies to train intensive care unit clinicians to better use data; and improve the quality of decision making in the intensive care unit as characterized by more consistent, patient-centered decisions with reduced decisional regret and work-related stress experienced by physicians.

9,1239,4,"OBJECTIVETo determine whether a behavioral intervention delivered through a video game can improve the appropriateness of trauma triage decisions in the emergency department of non-trauma centers.DESIGNRandomized clinical trial.SETTINGOnline intervention in national sample of emergency medicine physicians who make triage decisions at US hospitals.PARTICIPANTS368 emergency medicine physicians primarily working at non-trauma centers. A random sample (n=200) of those with primary outcome data was reassessed at six months.INTERVENTIONSPhysicians were randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to one hour of exposure to an adventure video game (Night Shift) or apps based on traditional didactic education (myATLS and Trauma Life Support MCQ Review), both on iPads. Night Shift was developed to recalibrate the process of using pattern recognition to recognize moderate-severe injuries (representativeness heuristics) through the use of stories to promote behavior change (narrative engagement). Physicians were randomized with a 2x2 factorial design to intervention (game v traditional education apps) and then to the experimental condition under which they completed the outcome assessment tool (low v high cognitive load). Blinding could not be maintained after allocation but group assignment was masked during the analysis phase.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESOutcomes of a virtual simulation that included 10 cases; in four of these the patients had severe injuries. Participants completed the simulation within four weeks of their intervention. Decisions to admit, discharge, or transfer were measured. The proportion of patients under-triaged (patients with severe injuries not transferred to a trauma center) was calculated then (primary outcome) and again six months later, with a different set of cases (primary outcome of follow-up study). The secondary outcome was effect of cognitive load on under-triage.RESULTS149 (81%) physicians in the game arm and 148 (80%) in the traditional education arm completed the trial. Of these, 64/100 (64%) and 58/100 (58%), respectively, completed reassessment at six months. The mean age was 40 (SD 8.9), 283 (96%) were trained in emergency medicine, and 207 (70%) were ATLS (advanced trauma life support) certified. Physicians exposed to the game under-triaged fewer severely injured patients than those exposed to didactic education (316/596 (0.53) v 377/592 (0.64), estimated difference 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.16; P<0.001). Cognitive load did not influence under-triage (161/308 (0.53) v 155/288 (0.54) in the game arm; 197/300 (0.66) v 180/292 (0.62) in the traditional educational apps arm; P=0.66). At six months, physicians exposed to the game remained less likely to under-triage patients (146/256 (0.57) v 172/232 (0.74), estimated difference 0.17, 0.09 to 0.25; P<0.001). No physician reported side effects. The sample might not reflect all emergency medicine physicians, and a small set of cases was used to assess performance.CONCLUSIONSCompared with apps based on traditional didactic education, exposure of physicians to a theoretically grounded video game improved triage decision making in a validated virtual simulation.

9,1240,4,"In this study, the authors investigated whether psychotherapist bias related to client bisexuality is most likely to occur with respect to judgments about stereotype-relevant clinical issues. Participants were 108 psychotherapists who read a fictitious intake report about a male client who was portrayed as heterosexual, gay, or bisexual. Client sexual orientation was behaviorally operationalized through reference to the sex of the client's present and previous romantic partners. Participants rated the case for the salience of a variety of clinical issues (some of which were related to bisexual stereotypes), global psychological functioning, and anticipated reactions to the client. Client sexual orientation had no effect for outcomes unrelated to bisexual stereotypes. In contrast, clinical issues related to bisexual stereotypes were rated as most salient to the case when the client was portrayed as bisexual rather than when the client was portrayed as heterosexual or gay. This effect remained significant even when participants' self-reported ability to avoid bias, self-presentational concerns, and response set related to perceptions of psychopathology were controlled for. Exploratory analyses suggested that this effect was partially mediated by stereotypes of bisexual men as confused and conflicted.

9,1241,4,"Risk assessment is one of the most important skills that pilots are expected to acquire to ensure the safe and successful management of flight. The traditional approach to the development of these skills requires pilots to directly engage with potentially hazardous events. Using low-flying as a context, the present study sought to test whether engagement with hazards in a simulated environment, together with feedback concerning performance, would improve pilots' risk assessment during a subsequent simulated test flight. The results indicated that engagement with the hazards, rather than the provision of feedback per se, was associated with behavior that reduced the risk to the aircraft, while maintaining operational performance. It was concluded that exposure to hazards within a simulated environment could provide the basis for the development of risk assessment skills amongst less experienced pilots. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Offensive foul situations are particularly ambiguous and complex, making the referee's task a difficult one. In such conditions of complexity and constraints of time, the referee is likely to be prone to systematic biases, as has been documented by previous research in other sport settings. We analyzed the referees' decisions in 250 instances of collisions between an attacking player and a defender. In these collisions the defender fell, and potentially an offensive foul could be called. We found no evidence of favoritism granted to the home team, to star players, or to high-reputation teams, or of small players being tackled by significantly larger opponents.

9,1245,9,"Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine the perceived familiarity of medical residents with statistical concepts, assess their ability to integrate these concepts in clinical scenarios, and investigate their susceptibility to the gambler’s fallacy and the conjunction fallacy. Methods: A multi-institutional, cross-sectional survey of Greek medical residents was performed. Participants were asked to indicate their familiarity with basic statistical concepts and answer clinically oriented questions designed to assess their biostatistics knowledge and cognitive biases. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistical models were used for the evaluation of data. Results: Out of 153 respondents (76.5% response rate), only two participants (1.3%) were able to answer all seven biostatistics knowledge questions correctly while 29 residents (19%) gave incorrect answers to all questions. The proportion of correct answers to each biostatistics knowledge question ranged from 15 to 51.6%. Residents with greater self-reported familiarity were more likely to perform better on the respective knowledge question (all p &lt; 0.01). Multivariate analysis of the effect of individual resident characteristics on questionnaire performance showed that previous education outside Greece, primarily during medical school, was associated with lower biostatistics knowledge scores ( p &lt; 0.001). A little more than half of the respondents (54.2%) answered the gambler’s fallacy quiz correctly. Residents with higher performance on the biostatistics knowledge questions were less prone to the gambler’s fallacy (odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence intervals 1.12-1.70, p = 0.003). Only 48 residents (31.4%) did not violate the conjunction rule. Conclusions: A large number of medical residents are unable to correctly interpret crucial statistical concepts that are commonly found in the medical literature. They are also especially prone to the gambler’s fallacy bias, which may undermine clinical judgment and medical decision making. Formalized systematic teaching of biostatistics during residency will be required to de-bias residents and ensure that they are proficient in understanding and communicating statistical information.

Study 2 was a vignette study in which therapists responded to one of two client presentations that varied relationship to client (your client vs. other's client). Using the attributional categories derived from Study 1, therapists rated the likelihood that each attribution caused the client's premature termination.

Judges' discourses were shaped by an idealisation of the nuclear family unit which resulted in a pro-access philosophy (Theme 1). The knowledge that domestic violence had occurred challenged this ideology and, to rhetorically manage this dilemma, judges' talk normalised or trivialised abusive parents' behaviour, which rendered domestic violence irrelevant to child custody and access (Theme 2).

Thirty-six police officers participated and executed a low- and high-anxiety video-based test that required them to shoot or not shoot at rapidly appearing suspects that either had a gun and “shot,” or had no gun and “surrendered.” Anxiety was manipulated by turning on (high anxiety) or turning off (low anxiety) a so-called “shootback canon” that could fire small plastic bullets at the participants. When performing under anxiety, police officers showed a response bias toward shooting, implying that they accidentally shot more often at suspects that surrendered. Furthermore, shot accuracy was lower under anxiety and officers responded faster when suspects had a gun. Finally, because gaze behavior appeared to be unaffected by anxiety, it is concluded that when they were anxious, officers were more inclined to respond on the basis of threat-related inferences and expectations rather than objective, task-relevant visual information.

9,1258,4,"Background: Many medical emergency practices are regulated by written procedures that normally provide reliable guidelines for action. In some cases, however, the consequences of following rule-based instructions can have unintended negative consequences. The article discusses a case—described on a type level—where the consequences of following a rule formulation could have been fatal.Case presentation: A weak and elderly patient has cardiac arrest, and a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) clause is written in the patient’s medical record. Paramedics at the scene cannot see that the patient’s general appearance match conditions which would indicate the DNR clause, so they start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and the patient survives. This turns out to be a crucial decision. The DNR clause is from an earlier bout with serious disease from which the patient has recovered, against all odds, and someone has forgotten to remove the clause from the medical record.Analysis: In order to be able to interpret the validity of written guidelines, paramedics and other health workers need to develop personal skills that transcend the ability simply to follow written instructions. Within traditional virtue ethics, personal judgment is conceived of as crucial for being able to make ‘good’ autonomous decisions. Virtue ethical analyses, decision-making abilities and non-technical communication skills are important as conceptual tools when health workers need to make difficult clinical decisions.Conclusion: The case study accentuates the significance of prudent judgment in medical practice. In the case described, the consequence of trusting the written advance directive could have been fatal, but the point is general: for the purpose of achieving excellent organizational performance, it is insufficient for health workers to rely uncritically on rules and procedures.

9,1259,4,"Background: History taking and empathetic communication are two important aspects in successful physician-patient interaction. Gathering important information from the patient's medical history is needed for effective clinical decision making while empathy is relevant for patient satisfaction. We wanted to investigate whether medical students near graduation are able to combine both skills as required in daily medical practice.Methods: Thirty near graduates from Hamburg Medical School participated in an assessment for clinical competences including a consultation hour with five standardized patients. Each patient interview was videotaped and standardized patients rated participants with the CARE questionnaire for consultation and relational empathy. All videotaped interviews were rated with a checklist based on the number of important medical aspects for each case. Data were analysed with the linear mixed model to correct for random effects. Regression analysis was performed to look for correlations between the number of questions asked by a participant and their respective empathy rating.Results: Of the 123 aspects that could have been gathered in total, students only requested 56.4% (95% CI 53.5-59.3). While no difference between male and female participants was found, a significant difference (p < .001) was observed between the two parts of the checklist with 61.1% (95% CI 57.9-64.3) of aspects asked for in part 1 (patient's symptoms) versus 52.0 (95 47.4-56.7) in part 2 (further history). All female standardized patients combined rated female participants (mean score 14.2, 95% CI 12.3-16.3) to be significantly (p < .01) more empathetic than male participants (mean score 19.2, 95% CI 16.3-22.6). Regression analysis revealed no correlation between the number of medical aspects gathered by a participant and his or her respective empathy score given by the standardized patient in the CARE questionnaire.Conclusion: Gathering sufficient medical data from a patient's history and empathetic communication are two completely separate sides of the coin of history taking.

9,1260,9,"Within sporting environments, it is inevitable that sports personnel (e.g., athletes, coaches, and officials) will continually find themselves developing expectations of others with whom they interact. With this in mind, the current study aimed to investigate how the informational cues of experience and the qualification pathway may affect both athletes’ and coaches’ judgments of perceived refereeing competence. A cross-sectional between-subjects experimental design was used using 112 soccer coaches and players. Participants were required to read 1 of 4 refereeing vignettes that manipulated the 2 independent variables of experience and the qualification pathway: experienced/longitudinal, experienced/fast-track, limited/longitudinal, and limited/fast-track. Following familiarization with the vignettes, participants completed the Assessment of Referee Competence Scale to rate their perceived competence of the referee. Competence was categorized through 6 characteristics: communication, confidence, fitness, impartiality, consistency, and respectfulness. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed the experienced referee was significantly more competent for all characteristics of refereeing competence compared to the limited condition. Although the qualification pathway yielded no significant differences between the longitudinal and fast-track condition, a follow-up analysis of variance revealed that referees associated with the longitudinal qualification pathway (i.e., had progressed through every level) were rated significantly more competent for the characteristic of communication than referees reported to be on the fast-track scheme. These results suggest that referees can harness the information they present to players and coaches before interaction, to help induce a positive first impression. By developing knowledge and skills in impression management, referees are likely to optimize their control of future interactions and reduce the likelihood of interpersonal conflict.

9,1261,4,"Most of classical decision making processes aim at selecting the ""best"" alternative or at ranking alternatives based on the opinions of decision makers. Often, such a process occurs among people (experts or decision makers) who are expected to achieve some shared consensus in ranking the alternatives. However, this is not likely to happen (especially for a large and heterogeneous collection of people) and decision makers tend to reveal groups characteristics derived from their different opinions. A major problem is that inconsistency in opinions arises as each expert has a limited knowledge, errors and misinterpretation of data can occur and thus it is not clear how groups can be identified to be internally consistent and non-conflicting. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which experts can be split into different sub-groups that share coherent and consistent opinions but are mutually in conflict in the ordering of the alternatives. We face this problem by presenting a non-linear integer programming model where each decision maker specifies incomplete preferences on pairs of alternatives and the objective is to obtain groups having the least possible degree of inconsistency. From a theoretical standpoint, we show that the proposed problem is non-convex and NP-Hard. Moreover, we validate the proposed approach with respect to a case study related to the 2018 Italian political elections. Specifically, we analyze the opinions of 33 decision makers and we show that the proposed technique is able to identify subgroups characterized by large internal consistency, i.e., the members of each sub-groups express similar judgements upon the different options, while such options are evaluated very differently by the different sub-groups. Interestingly, while dividing the decision makers in three sub-groups, we obtain group rankings that reflect the structure of the Italian political parties or coalitions at the time, i.e., left-wing, right-wing and populists, even if such kind of information has not been directly provided by the decision makers nor used within the proposed case study.

Laboratory practices being provided during their education play a crucial role in their professional development and the usefulness of these practices is possible and can be enriched if the students possess prior scientific skills. The purpose of this study is to determine the scientific process skills of second year medical students in Suleyman Demirel University, Faculty of Medicine, Turkey.Methods: The study was conducted in April 2006 by using the Scientific Process Skills Questionnaire (SPSQ) for laboratory practices. Randomly selected (n = 76) second year medical students participated in the study.Results: Nine basic scientific process skills were investigated. All of the students responded correctly to the question that measured their ability to interpret data. Students abilities to set up hypothesis and make estimations were found quite high. (94.7 %, 92.1 % respectively) The two skills that were challenging to students were the ability to make an observation and their proficiency in scales. The percentage of correct responses to those questions were 50 % and 50.5 % respectively.Conclusions: The study suggests that students in the study group possess the necessary scientific process skills at some degree (86 %). However, this ratio, thus the productivity of laboratory practices can be enhanced by building up on skills such as making observations and interpreting scales.

9,1264,9,"Introduction: Facial profile disharmonies in the anteroposterior (AP) position of the mandible are among the most frequent reasons that patients seek orthodontic treatment. Various methods are available for assessing profile preferences, and differences between them could affect treatment decisions. The purposes of this study were to compare and contrast 3 methods of evaluating profile preferences for the AP position of the mandible. Methods: Facial profile preferences of white orthodontists (n = 28) and white (n = 56) and Japanese-American (n = 55) laypeople were evaluated. The esthetic significance of variations in the AP position of the mandible was investigated by using 3 methods: a traditional semantic differential scale, the Perceptometrics method (Health Programs Intl, Wellesley, Mass), and the implicit association test (IAT). Results: Findings from the semantic differential scale show that, overall, there is a general preference among orthodontists and laypeople for an orthognathic profile (P <.001). Findings from the Perceptometrics method indicate that orthodontists consider the most pleasing profile to be more forward than do lay subjects (P <.001). The IAT results show a positive bias among all 3 groups toward orthognathic profiles and a negative bias toward profiles with mandibular retrognathism or prognathism. The AT suggested that laypeople were more tolerant of mandibular prognathism in men than in women (P <.01), and more tolerant of mandibular retrognathia in white women than in men (P =.03).

9,1265,4,"Financial decision-making is governed by cognitive and emotional processes. However, it is possible to learn how to manage both before making a decision based on experience. Electroencephalography might provide some insight into what is behind these choices by analyzing the slow negativity preceding a risky decision, known as the decision preceding negativity (DPN). The DPN is involved in cognitive processes associated with the elaboration of the planned response as well as the anticipation of the affective motivational stimuli. Using monetary gamble under risk (outcome probabilities are known) and ambiguity (outcome probabilities are unknown), we studied the DPN in a group of investment bankers, to see if individual financial experience influences anticipatory potentials that precede choices. Our results showed that investment bankers are able to shorten their anticipatory decision-making process by having a DPN closer to motor response. As this occurs, the prefrontal and orbitofrontal brain areas under risk were activated due to the role that emotions play in financial decision-making. On the other hand, under the ambiguity condition, activation of the prefrontal areas was caused by cognitive regulation of emotion. Our conclusion is that financial experience also influences risky choices by shortening the decision-making process while balancing cognitive and emotional processes, which depend on the amount of missing information.

Our aim was to determine whether a cognitive forcing tool can reduce the rates of error in clinical decision making. A secondary objective was to understand the process by which this effect might occur.MethodsWe hypothesised that using a cognitive forcing tool would reduce diagnostic error rates. To test this hypothesis, a novel online case-based approach was used to conduct a single blinded randomized clinical trial conducted from January 2017 to September 2018. In addition, a qualitative series of think aloud interviews were conducted with 20 doctors from a UK teaching hospital in 2018. The primary outcome was the diagnostic error rate when solving bias inducing clinical vignettes. A volunteer sample of medical professionals from across the UK, Republic of Ireland and North America. They ranged in seniority from medical student to Attending Physician.ResultsSeventy six participants were included in the study. The data showed doctors of all grades routinely made errors related to cognitive bias. There was no difference in error rates between groups (mean 2.8 cases correct in intervention vs 3.1 in control group, 95% CI -0.94 - 0.45 P=0.49). The qualitative protocol revealed that the cognitive forcing strategy was well received and a produced a subjectively positive impact on doctors' accuracy and thoughtfulness in clinical cases.ConclusionsThe quantitative data failed to show an improvement in accuracy despite a positive qualitative experience.

9,1267,4,"Attorneys may hold expectations about jurors based on stereotypes about the relationships between demographic characteristics and attitudes. Attorneys test their hypotheses about prospective jurors during voir dire, but it is unclear whether their questioning strategies are likely to produce accurate information from jurors. In 2 studies, attorneys and law students formulated voir dire questions to test a particular hypothesis about the attitudes held by a prospective juror (venireperson) and provided their subsequent inferences about that individual given certain hypothetical responses to the questions. Bayes’s theorem was used to compare attorneys’ actual conclusions about the venireperson with the conclusions they would reach if correctly using the available information. Attorneys’ conclusions were biased by the questions they asked, and in some cases, by the hypothesis that they were asked to test. Compared with normative models derived using Bayes’ theorem, attorneys overrelied on venirepersons’ responses when drawing conclusions about their attitudes. These findings suggest that even if traditional attorney-conducted voir dire elicited accurate information about prospective jurors’ attitudes, attorneys may not use that information to draw normatively accurate conclusions about the attitudes that they hold.

,1268,2,"Objective. Because physicians customarily obtain histories before examining children in cases of possible sexual abuse, and because the resulting diagnostic opinions can influence important social and legal decisions, we investigated whether clinical histories influence physicians' interpretations of girls' genital findings.Design. In mailed questionnaires, 1387 randomly selected Fellows of the American Academy of Pediatrics and all 802 members of four professional groups concerned with child abuse or pediatric gynecology were asked to interpret seven simulated cases. Respondents were asked to interpret seven additional cases in separate questionnaires mailed 4 months later. Both sets of cases involved the same seven photographs of girls' external genitalia. However, in six of the seven case pairs, the histories in the two questionnaires differed in the extent to which they suggested sexual abuse. In the remaining (control) pair, the same history was presented in both questionnaires.Results. Of 2189 physicians, 1114 (50.9%) responded. Responses from 604 physicians (54.2%) were eligible for analysis. Overall, the genital findings were interpreted most consistently by the most experienced physicians and least consistently by the least experienced physicians. The proportion of physicians whose interpretations of a photograph reversed in the direction suggested by the change in the associated history from ""no indication of abuse"" to ""probable abuse,"" or vice versa, ranged for experienced physicians from none to 5.6%; for moderately experienced physicians from 1.6% to 19.8%; and for inexperienced physicians from 3.6% to 27.2%. This difference between the experience groups was statistically significant in four case pairs. Mean interpretation scores for genital findings changed significantly when the histories changed in two case pairs for the experienced physicians, in five pairs for the moderately experienced physicians, and in all six pairs for the inexperienced physicians.Conclusions.

Taking stressor–emotion–control perspectives, the authors examine day-level relationships between call center workers’ customer mistreatment experiences and their impaired recovery outcomes mediated by end-of-work negative affect. Furthermore, control concepts in the job and personal domains are tested as cross-level moderators. Specifically, job control and recovery self-efficacy are identified to reduce the within-person process of customer mistreatment affecting recovery outcomes. Seventy-one call center employees completed a registration survey and then two daily surveys over 2 consecutive weeks, yielding 481 time-lagged day-level observations. Multilevel path analyses show that customer mistreatment is positively associated with increased negative affect, which, in turn, predicts poor sleep quality at night and poor recovery state the next morning. Job control attenuates the day-level effect of customer mistreatment on negative affect, and recovery self-efficacy alleviates the day-level effects of negative affect on sleep quality and next-morning recovery state. The findings shed light on the recovery-impairing effects of customer mistreatment and its important boundary conditions.

However, little is known about how clinicians interpret conflicting subgroup data.Methods We mailed a self-administered survey to all practicing cardiologists (n = 309) and 695 randomly chosen other specialists in Ontario, Canada. The survey presented 6 hypothetical trials where a subgroup result deviated from the overall result. We also elicited responses to some general statements about clinical evidence and subgroups.Results Completed surveys were received from 435 physicians (44%). Faced with overall benefit but no apparent treatment effect in a subgroup, almost 44% would exclude subgroup-type patients, notwithstanding the hazard of P error. Given overall harm but significant benefit for a subgroup, responses were split approximately 60:40 between continuing conventional therapy for all and treating subgroup-type patients with the new drug. For an overall null result with a positive treatment-subgroup interaction term, 25% of respondents would continue conventional therapy, whereas 69% would adopt the new drug for subgroup-type patients. Physicians with an academic appointment, devoting more time to research, or with formal training in research methodology were more likely to ignore subgroups unless a treatment-subgroup interaction term was significant (P values ranging from .018 to <.0001). Asked if in general they paid special attention to individual subgroup results, respondents were again divided with 37.5% agreeing, 39.5% disagreeing, and the rest undecided.Conclusion Clinicians disagree sharply in interpretation of clinical trials when the overall and subgroup results diverge.

9,1272,9,"PurposeTo investigate variation in optometric referral decision-making and the influence of experience and continuing education and training (CET).MethodsResultsTo gain insight into unwarranted variation in referral activity in the United Kingdom (UK): (1) triage data were audited to investigate source of referral, provisional diagnosis, and outcome; (2) an online system was developed to present two sets of 10 vignettes, designed to avoid prompting answers. Participating optometrists completed 10 pre-CET vignettes, recording their tests and management decisions. The main group of participants chose whatever CET they wished over a 6-month period and then completed another 10 post-CET vignettes. A second group of newly-qualified optometrists completed the vignettes before and after a CET course intervention, followed by a third group of pre-registered optometrists with an intervention of 6-months experience of their pre-registration year.The audit identified 1951 optometric referrals and 158 optometrists (211 referrals were from general medical practitioners), with 122 of the 158 optometrists making fewer than ten referrals. Two newly-qualified optometrists generated 12.5% of the total referrals in the audit (N = 2162). Many suspect glaucoma referrals were based on a single suspect measurement resulting in a high discharge rate after community review, as did referrals for certain fundus-related appearances for which no treatment was indicated. The intervention of gaining CET points appeared to have no significant impact (p = 0.37) on referral decision-making, although this part of the study was underpowered. Self-selection bias was confirmed in the main group. When the main group and newly-qualified practitioners were compared, the number of referrals was negatively associated with time since qualification (p = 0.005). When all 20 referral decisions were compared, all optometrists referring more than 10 vignette patients came from a group of newly-qualified practitioners up to 2 years post-qualification. Pre-registered optometrists generally referred more appropriately than newly-qualified. Upon qualification, there was a significant increase in the number of sight tests undertaken per day (p = <0.0005).ConclusionsGaining CET points alone is unlikely to significantly improve referral decision-making.

9,1273,4,"Background: worldwide efforts are under way to improve the quality of clinical practice. Most quality measurements, however, are poorly validated, expensive, and difficult to compare among sites.Objective: To validate whether vignettes accurately measure the quality of clinical practice by using a comparison with standardized patients (the gold standard method), and to determine whether vignettes are a more or less accurate method than medical record abstraction.Design: Prospective, multisite study.Setting: Outpatient primary care clinics in 2 Veterans Affairs medical centers and 2 large, private medical centers.Participants: 144 of 163 eligible physicians agreed to participate, and, of these, 116 were randomly selected to see standardized patients, to complete vignettes, or both.Measurements: Scores, expressed as the percentage of explicit quality criteria correctly completed, were obtained by using 3 methods.Results: Among all physicians, the quality of clinical practice as measured by the standardized patients was 73% correct (95% CI, 72.1% to 73.4%). By using exactly the same criteria, physicians scored 68% (CI, 67.9% to 68.9%) when measured by the vignettes but only 63% (CI, 62.7% to 64.0%) when assessed by medical record abstraction. These findings were consistent across all diseases and were independent of case complexity or physician training level. Vignettes also accurately measured unnecessary care. Finally, vignettes seem to capture the range in the quality of clinical practice among physicians within a site.Limitations: Despite finding variation in the quality of clinical practice, we did not determine whether poorer quality translated into worse health status for patients. In addition, the quality scores are based on measurements from 1 patient-provider interaction. As with all other scoring criteria, vignette criteria must be regularly updated.Conclusions: Vignettes are a valid tool for measuring the quality of clinical practice. They can be used for diverse clinical settings, diseases, physician types, and situations in which case-mix variation is a concern. They are inexpensive and easy to use.

9,1274,9,"Objective: We assessed the effects of source type bias (human or automation) on adviser trust in a dual adviser decision-making task.Background: Source type and reliability's effects on adviser trust have been studied in a dual-adviser context, but the influence of pedigree (perceived expertise) across source types lacked robust investigation. As situations with two decision-aids of uneven pedigree can easily arise, it is critical to understand how operators are biased towards a decision-aid of a certain source type and pedigree.Method: A decision-making task similar to the paradigm of Convoy Leader (Lyons and Stokes, 2012) was given to participants, where a military convoy route had to be selected in the presence of IEDs and insurgent activity. We measured behavioral reliance and trust attitudes. Pedigree was manipulated via controlled adviser descriptions, in a manner consistent with past investigations (Madhavan and Wiegmann, 2007a).Results: We found a trust bias towards the human adviser, reversed only when there is a far greater pedigree in the automated adviser. Trust attitudes were also strongly indicative of reliance behaviors.Conclusion: Pedigree is a strong influencer of trust in a decision-aid and biased towards human advisers. Trust is highly predictive of reliance decisions. Application: System designers must take care with how ""expert"" automation is portrayed, particularly if it is used in conjunction with other human advisers (e.g.: conflicting advice from air-traffic control and an onboard system).",Pearson,2019,Who's the real expert here?

Exp 1 with 44 auditors examined whether part-set cueing affects the ability of auditors to recall diagnoses, and if so, whether memory inhibition is affected by the plausibility of the hypotheses. Exp 2 with 73 auditors examines whether the part-set cueing effect is sensitive to changes in the symptoms that drive the diagnosis and whether differences in inhibition occur because of prompt plausibility or because of target plausibility. Exp 3 with 90 auditors extends the findings of the 1st 2 experiments to hypothesis generation and discriminates between competing accounts for the part-set cueing effect. Results show that part-set cueing effects occur during hypothesis generation and that they are robust to changes in the symptoms. However, the results from the experiments reveal an asymmetric inhibition effect. Inhibition is significant when prompts contain low plausibility hypotheses that are also high in severity. When prompts consist of high plausibility or low severity hypotheses, no inhibition is observed. Findings are consistent with an editing account of the part-set cueing phenomenon.

9,1276,4,"PurposeHealth providers' implicit racial bias negatively affects communication and patient reactions to many medical interactions. However, its effects on racially discordant oncology interactions are largely unknown. Thus, we examined whether oncologist implicit racial bias has similar effects in oncology interactions. We further investigated whether oncologist implicit bias negatively affects patients' perceptions of recommended treatments (i.e., degree of confidence, expected difficulty). We predicted oncologist implicit bias would negatively affect communication, patient reactions to interactions, and, indirectly, patient perceptions of recommended treatments.MethodsParticipants were 18 non-black medical oncologists and 112 black patients. Oncologists completed an implicit racial bias measure several weeks before video-recorded treatment discussions with new patients. Observers rated oncologist communication and recorded interaction length of time and amount of time oncologists and patients spoke. Following interactions, patients answered questions about oncologists' patient-centeredness and difficulty remembering contents of the interaction, distress, trust, and treatment perceptions.ResultsAs predicted, oncologists higher in implicit racial bias had shorter interactions, and patients and observers rated these oncologists' communication as less patient-centered and supportive. Higher implicit bias also was associated with more patient difficulty remembering contents of the interaction. In addition, oncologist implicit bias indirectly predicted less patient confidence in recommended treatments, and greater perceived difficulty completing them, through its impact on oncologists' communication (as rated by both patients and observers).ConclusionOncologist implicit racial bias is negatively associated with oncologist communication, patients' reactions to racially discordant oncology interactions, and patient perceptions of recommended treatments. These perceptions could subsequently directly affect patient-treatment decisions. Thus, implicit racial bias is a likely source of racial treatment disparities and must be addressed in oncology training and practice.

9,1277,9,"This study applied an intervention program, based on video feedback and questioning, to expert female volleyball players to improve their tactical knowledge. The sample consisted of eight female attackers (26 +/- 2.6 years old) from the Spanish National Volleyball Team, who were divided into an experimental group (n = 4) and a control group (n = 4). The video feedback and questioning program applied in the study was developed over eight reflective sessions and consisted of three phases: viewing of the selected actions, self-analysis and reflection by the attacker, and joint player-coach analysis. The attackers were videotaped in an actual game and four clips (situations) of each of the attackers were chosen for each reflective session.

9,1279,4,"Background: Prognostication after a stroke has important implications for care and for decisions made by patients and their families. It is not clear why clinicians, even experienced stroke neurologists, poorly estimate the risk of disability and death following stroke. Methods: We analyzed the results from the Clinician Judgment versus Risk Score to predict Stroke Outcomes study in which each clinician estimated the risk of death and the risk of death or disability in 5 case-based ischemic stroke scenarios. We employed a mixed-effect linear model to disentangle the ability of clinicians to discriminate between poor and good prognosis cases (slope) from the calibration of quantitative estimates (intercept), and to assess for any effect of anchoring in the death or disability condition (through a comparison with the death condition). Results: One hundred eleven clinicians made 1665 predictions. Clinicians were able to discriminate between cases with low and high risks of death (slope of .81, 95% confidence interval [CI].70-.93), but the quantitative estimates were not well calibrated (intercept of 5.14, 95% CI 3.97-6.33). The discrimination was poorer (slope of .67, 95% CI.60-.75), but the calibration was better (intercept of -.34, 95% CI -5.43 to 4.98) in the death or disability estimates. Conclusion: Poor stroke prognostication can be explained by poor calibration and an anchoring effect, which are both amenable to specific training interventions. (C) 2016 National Stroke Association.

However, investigation into physician, system and patient factors relevant to this decision making is lacking. We surveyed a national randomized sample of practicing hematologists/medical oncologists identified through the AMA (American Medical Association) masterfile. A modified Dillman approach was utilized to encourage survey response. From 1200 surveyed, a total of 113 physicians responded. In all, 68% were male, 62% identified as White/non-Hispanic, 79% practiced in non-academic settings and 80% reported spending 75-100% of their professional effort in clinical care. Using clinical vignettes, we detected significantly increased odds for HCT non-referral according to age (age 60 vs 30, odds ratio (OR) 8.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.9-11.7, P<0.0001), insurance coverage (no coverage vs coverage, OR 6.9, 95% CI: 5.2-9.1, P<0.0001) and race (African-American vs Caucasian, OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.9-2.9, P<0.0001).

9,1287,4,"Background: Well-designed randomised clinical trials (RCTs) provide the best evidence to inform decision-making and should be the default option for evaluating surgical procedures. Such trials can be challenging, and surgeons' preferences may influence whether trials are initiated and successfully conducted and their results accepted. Preferences are particularly problematic when surgeons' views play a key role in procedure selection and patient eligibility. The bases of such preferences have rarely been explored. Our aim in this qualitative study was to investigate surgeons' preferences regarding the feasibility of surgical RCTs and their understanding of study design issues using breast reconstruction surgery as a case study.Methods: Semistructured qualitative interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of 35 professionals practicing at 15 centres across the United Kingdom. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using constant comparative techniques. Sampling, data collection and analysis were conducted concurrently and iteratively until data saturation was achieved.Results: Surgeons often struggle with the concept of equipoise. We found that if surgeons did not feel 'in equipoise', they did not accept randomisation as a method of treatment allocation. The underlying reasons for limited equipoise were limited appreciation of the methodological weaknesses of data derived from nonrandomised studies and little understanding of pragmatic trial design. Their belief in the value of RCTs for generating high-quality data to change or inform practice was not widely held.Conclusion: There is a need to help surgeons understand evidence, equipoise and bias.

This study aims to assess how aware surgeons are of surgical equipment and regularly used services.Methods: A single sided hard copy questionnaire asking for the estimate cost of 24 surgical devices/services was handed out to individuals at two separate UK annual conferences. Items and services which are regularly used and/or clinically significant were selected and, where possible, alternatives to those items were included for comparison. Participants were also asked for their grade and specialty. An estimate was deemed correct if it was within 20% of the actual cost. Planned subgroup analyses for grade and specialty were performed.Results: The 143 participants consisted of 23 (16%) consultants, 39 (27%) registrars, 33 (23%) SHOs and 48 (34%) foundation doctors. Of the 95 participants who were SHO grade or more senior, 67 (71%) work within general surgery. Across all items, only 9.6% of estimates were correct. There was no statistically significant difference between training levels (consultant 11.5%, registrar 10.1%, SHO 8.6%, foundation 8.9%; p = 0.253).

9,1289,9,"Objective: We sought to investigate whether expert-novice differences in visual search behavior found in other domains also apply to accident scenes and the emergency response domain. Background: Emergency service professionals typically arrive at accidents only after being dispatched when a civilian witness has called an emergency dispatch number. Differences in visual search behavior between the civilian witness (usually a novice in terms of emergency response) and the professional first responders (experts at emergency response) could thus result in the experts being given insufficient or erroneous information, which would lead them to arrive unprepared for the actual situation. Method: A between-subjects, controlled eye-tracking experiment with 20 novices and 17 experts (rescue and ambulance service personnel) was conducted to explore expert-novice differences in visual search of accident and control images. Results: The results showed that the experts spent more time looking at task-relevant areas of the accident images than novices did, as predicted by the information reduction hypothesis. The longer time was due to longer fixation durations rather than a larger fixation count. Conclusion: Expert-novice differences in visual search are present in the emergency domain. Given that this domain is essential to saving lives and also relies heavily on novices as the first link in the chain of response, such differences deserve further exploration. Application: Visual search behavior from experts can be used for training purposes.

9,1291,9,"Purpose To identify and analyse variations in self-reported decision-making strategies between medical professionals of different specialty and grade.Study design We conducted a cross-sectional survey of doctors of different specialities and grades at St. George's Hospital, London, UK. We administered 226 questionnaires asking participants to assign proportions of their clinical decision-making behaviour to four strategies: intuitive, analytical, rule-based and creative.Results We found that physicians said they used rule-based decision-making significantly more than did surgeons and anaesthetists (p = 0.025) and analytical decision-making strategies significantly less (p = 0.003). In addition, we found that both intuitive (p = 0.0005) and analytical (p = 0.0005) decision-making had positive associations with increasing experience, whereas rulebased decision-making was negatively associated with greater experience (p = 0.0005).Conclusions Decision-making strategies may evolve with increasing clinical experience from a predominant use of rule-based approaches towards greater use of intuitive or analytical methods depending on the familiarity and acuity of the clinical situation. Rule-based strategies remain important for delivering evidencebased care, particularly for less experienced clinicians, and for physicians more than surgeons, possibly due to the greater availability and applicability of guidelines for medical problems. Anaesthetists and intensivists tend towards more analytical decision-making than physicians; an observation which might be attributable to the greater availability and use of objective data in the care environment. As part of broader training in nontechnical skills and human factors, increasing awareness among trainees of medical decision-making models and their potential pitfalls might contribute to reducing the burden of medical error in terms of morbidity, mortality and litigation.",Pumphrey,2019,"Head, heart or checklist?

9,1292,4,"OBJECTIVE: The optimization of a diagnosis process and fluency in the Health Care sector in Romania. A key to discover this complex process was to determine a correlation between the physicians and the use of information technology, on one side and the patients' perspective on the other.HYPOTHESIS: Integrating information technology in a physician's activity will lead to lower costs and less time spent while diagnosing patients. Using the electronic medical records and introducing a unified database with the patients' medical histories will make the process of diagnosis easier.METHODS: We studied the diagnosis from the point of view of 304 patients in a public hospital and 320 physicians working there.RESULTS: We believed that time and accessibility to different physicians makes the diagnosis process a burden for a patient and implicitly lead to dissatisfaction with health care services. We supposed that the burden of diagnosis for physicians comes from the lack of Internet connection and computer usage knowledge. We have found out that most physicians know how to use the computer at an intermediate level and have access to Internet, online journals and databases and do not use emails to a higher extent to communicate to other specialists, but do not rely entirely on the electronic medical records. Most physicians think that it is not technology, which stands in the way of proper and fast diagnosis but the financing and the paper work from the Romanian health system. Solutions that might be taken into account to entirely motivate physicians to use electronic medical records are: 1. Adjustments can be made to the computer software interface in order to make the design more consistent (to eliminate the paper forms) and user friendly. 2. Physicians can be provided with more training and knowledge.DISCUSSION: After some statistical tests have been applied to find a correlation between the chosen variables, we have reached the conclusion that the results are encouraging and there is no correlation between the degree of the impact of Preventive Medicine and the healthy behavior of the respondents.",Purcarea,2011,Optimizing the technological and informational relationship of the health care process and of the communication between physician and patient--factors that have an impact on the process of diagnosis from the physician's and the patient's perspectives.,Journal of medicine and life,4,198,206,Web of Science,"Purcarea, V L; Petrescu, D G; Gheorghe, I R; Petrescu, C M"
,1293,2,"When claimants press their claims without counsel, they fail at virtually every stage of civil litigation and overwhelmingly fail to obtain meaningful access to justice. This research program harnesses psychological science to experimentally test a novel hypothesis: mainly, a claimant's pro se status itself sends a signal that biases decision making about the claimant and her claim. We conducted social psychological experiments with the public (N=157), law students (N=198), and employment discrimination lawyers (N=39), holding the quality and merit of a Title VII sex discrimination case constant. In so doing, we examined whether a claimant's pro se status itself shapes stereotypes held about the claimant and biases decision making about settlement awards. These experiments reveal that pro se status influences stereotypes of claimants and settlement awards received. Moreover, the signaling effect of pro se status is exacerbated by socialization in the legal profession. Among law-trained individuals (i.e., law students and lawyers), a claimant's pro se status generates negative stereotypes about the claimant and these negative stereotypes explain the adverse effect of pro se status on decision making about settlement awards.",Quintanilla,2017,The Signaling Effect of Pro se Status,LAW AND SOCIAL INQUIRY-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION,42,1091,1121,Web of Science,"Quintanilla, Victor D.; Allen, Rachel A.; Hirt, Edward R."

9,1300,4,"Construct: Authors examined whether a new vignette-based instrument could isolate and quantify heuristic bias. Background: Heuristics are cognitive shortcuts that may introduce bias and contribute to error. There is no standardized instrument available to quantify heuristic bias in clinical decision making, limiting future study of educational interventions designed to improve calibration of medical decisions. This study presents validity data to support a vignette-based instrument quantifying bias due to the anchoring, availability, and representativeness heuristics. Approach: Participants completed questionnaires requiring assignment of probabilities to potential outcomes of medical and nonmedical scenarios.

This result remained significant analyzing medical scenarios alone (Version A, M = 9.41, SD = 3.92; Version B, M = 8.86, SD = 4.09), t (1204) = 2.36, p = .02. Analyzing medical scenarios by heuristic revealed a significant difference between Version A and B for availability (Version A, M = 6.52, SD = 3.32; Version B, M = 5.52, SD = 3.05), t (404) = 3.04, p = .003, and representativeness (Version A, M = 11.45, SD = 3.12; Version B, M = 10.67, SD = 3.71), t (396) = 2.28, p = .02, but not anchoring. Stratifying by training level, students maintained a significant difference between Version A and B medical scenarios (Version A, M = 9.83, SD = 3.75; Version B, M = 9.00, SD = 3.98), t (465) = 2.29, p = .02, but not residents or attendings. Stratifying by heuristic and training level, availability maintained significance for students (Version A, M = 7.28, SD = 3.46; Version B, M = 5.82, SD = 3.22), t (153) = 2.67, p = .008, and residents (Version A, M = 7.19, SD = 3.24; Version B, M = 5.56, SD = 2.72), t (77) = 2.32, p = .02, but not attendings.

9,1301,4,"An international survey has been undertaken to assess variation in professional assessment of orthodontic treatment need. Ninety-seven orthodontists from nine countries examined a standard sample of 240 dental study casts to judge the need for orthodontic treatment in terms of dental health, dental esthetics, and deviation from normal. Participants also indicated their assessment of treatment complexity and whether they would recommend treatment. Practitioners' subjective assessments were found to be only moderately reliable overall. Of the cases examined, 67% obtained a consensus of 80% or greater on the need for treatment. Logistic regression equations were derived to explain the observed variation in treatment decisions. It was found that occlusal traits from the dental casts were highly predictive of the treatment decision, and that the practitioners' country of origin and payment methods are important influences on prescribing behavior. The treatment decisions were predicted with an accuracy of 84% by using occlusal score values for the dental esthetics, the degree of upper arch crowding, the presence of crossbite, the anterior overbite, and the buccal segment sagittal relationship. It is suggested that these traits may form the basis for an internationally validated index of treatment need for use in clinical audit and orthodontic research.",Richmond,1998,International comparisons of professional assessments in orthodontics: Part 1 - Treatment need,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS,113,180,185,Web of Science,"Richmond, S; Daniels, CP"

We find that amateur auto racers are more rational than either students or other risky recreationists because they are less likely to overemphasize low-probability events.

9,1303,9,"BackgroundThe Second Stage of the Physician Exam at the end of the 5th year of medical school in Germany is the final step before the Practical Year. An exam preparatory class can cover the complete content of Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN) in two days. We raise the question of whether such training might promote students' interest in the given specialty during occupational decision making and whether it could even be used by hospitals as a recruitment tool. This investigation is even more important in the context of fierce competition among young professionals at clinics and in different specialties.MethodsWe conducted a multimodal course evaluation for four exam preparatory courses (each of which lasted two days and involved 8.5h of teaching), including pre- and post-course tests with 20 multiple-choice questions to quantify the level of skill gain. Additionally, a standardized evaluation of course satisfaction was performed, followed by a post-exam questionnaire that dealt with studying activities and individual professional objectives.ResultsOverall, n=197 students took part in four identical courses. Among them, n=121 completed the pre-/post-course tests, n=170 completed the evaluation, and n=110 completed the post-exam questionnaire.

9,1305,4,"Objectives. In this study, the authors examined the dentist's view of the patient's experience and concordance with the patient's rating of satisfaction.Methods. Practitioners from 197 practices in The National Dental Practice-Based Research Network recruited consecutively seen patients who had defective restorations that were replaced or repaired. At the end of the dental visit, the treating dentist and 5,315 patients completed and returned a survey that asked about the patient's satisfaction. Results. Most dentists viewed their patients as having been satisfied with the treatment experience (n = 4,719 [89 percent]) and as having perceived them as friendly (n = 5,136 [97 percent]). Dentists had less strong feelings about whether patients had a preference for the restorative material (n = 2,271 [43 percent]) or an interest in obtaining information about the procedure (n = 1,757 [33 percent]). Overall, patients were satisfied, and most of the time dentists correctly predicted this outcome. Among patients who were less than satisfied, there was a substantial subset of cases in which dentists were not aware of this dissatisfaction.Conclusion. For improved patient-centered care, dentists should assess patients' desires, expectations and perceptions of the dental care experience and then manage or correct the expectations and perceptions as needed.Practical Implications.

9,1306,4,"Background: The main focus of the training of psychiatrists is on diagnosis and treatment based on the traditional doctor-centered approach to the psychiatric interview. Less attention is given to the correct handling of patients' emotional concerns, which is crucial for the patient-physician relationship, but also for improving diagnostic and treatment decisions. The aim of this study is to assess psychiatrists' responses to patients' concerns and worries. Method: 118 consultations, conducted by 10 residents in psychiatry with 20 simulated patients, have been coded using the Verona Psychiatric Interview Classification System. Lag1 sequential analysis and a multinomial logit regression analysis were performed to investigate the relationship between patients' expressions of concern and psychiatrists' subsequent interventions in terms of patient-centered skills. Results: Compared to doctor-centered interventions, all patients' expressions of concern increased the probability of passive listening (odds ratios between 2.4 and 4.2). They also increased the occurrence of emotion focusing interventions (odds ratios between 3.3 and 1.7), which however remained rare (4% of residents' total responses). A small although significant increase in the likelihood of active listening expressions was observed as a response to two types of patient expressions of concern: statements of feelings (odds ratio 1.4) and expression of opinions regarding problematic psychosocial issues (odds ratio of 1.7). Conclusions: Young psychiatrists are good passive listeners but need to improve active listening skills which, together with emotion focusing skills, should be a major learning target in psychiatry. These patient-centered interviewing skills should integrate those traditionally used for attributing ICD-10 and/or DSM-IV categories.

9,1307,9,"Robust assessment of Advanced Life Support (ALS) competence is paramount to the credibility of ALS-provider certification and for estimating the learning outcome and retention of ALS competence following the courses. The European Resuscitation Council (ERC) provides two sets of MCQs and four Cardiac Arrest Simulation Test (CASTest) scenarios for the assessments according to guidelines 2005. Aims: To analyse the reliability and validity of the individual sub-tests provided by ERC and to find a combination of MCQ and CASTest that provides a reliable and valid single effect measure of ALS competence.Methods: Two groups of participants were included in this randomised, controlled experimental study: a group of newly graduated doctors, who had not taken the ALS course (N = 17) and a group of students, who had passed the ALS course 9 months before the study (N = 16). Reliability in terms of inter-rater agreement and generalisability across skills scenarios were estimated. Validity was studied in terms of equality of test difficulty and ability to discriminate performance between the groups.Results: Inter-rater agreement on checklist scores were generally high, Intra-class Correlation Coefficients between 0.766 and 0.977. Inter-rater agreements on pass/fail decisions were not perfect. The one MCQ test was significantly more difficult than the other. There were no significant differences between CASTests. Generalisability theory was use to identify a composite of MCQ and CASTest scenarios that possessed high reliability, equality of test sets, and ability to discriminate between the two groups of supposedly different ALS competence.Conclusions: ERC sub-tests of ALS competence possess sufficient reliability and validity.

In case 1 (production processes), acts (changing the process) were considered better than omissions when the decision maker did not know the outcome or knew that it was better than the status quo. Acts were considered worse than omissions once the decision maker learned that the foregone option would have led to an even better outcome. In case 2 (medical treatment), act vs omission again interacted with gain vs loss (relative to the status quo) unless the outcome of the foregone option was known, in which case act vs omission interacted with better vs worse (of the two options). In case 3 (fetal testing), subjects tolerated less risk of miscarriage when a potential for regret was present (because the test with the risk. of miscarriage, although better, might miss disorders that another test would detect). This effect was greater for actions than omissions. In case 4 (vaccination), subjects showed less tolerance of vaccine risk when the decision maker would know about the outcome of vaccination or nonvaccination.

9,1309,4,"Context. Research on decision making suggests that a wide range of spontaneous processes may influence medical judgment.Objectives. We considered an easily accessible strategy, anchoring and insufficient adjustment, which might contribute to health care professionals' miscalibration of patients' pain.Methods. A sample (n=423) of physicians, nurses, medical students, and nursing students participated in a computerized task that showed 16 vignettes featuring fictitious patients reporting headache. In the experimental condition, participants were asked to evaluate the severity of the patient's pain before and after knowing the patient's rating. In the control condition, participants were shown all information about the patient at the same time and were required to make judgments in a single stage.Results. When participants could express an initial impression before knowing the patient's rating, they fully anchored to their initial impressions in almost half of the responses. Moreover, even among those who revised their initial impression, the extent of the revision was often insufficient. Greater anchoring was associated with patients' ratings that were higher than the participants' initial impression. Finally, we provided evidence that anchoring increased pain miscalibration. We discuss our findings in terms of their contribution to the understanding of the cognitive processes involved in pain assessment.Conclusion. When estimating patients' pain intensity, observers are driven by anchoring, a rule of thumb that might have pernicious consequences in terms of unwarranted overreliance on initial impressions and insufficient revision in light of relevant disconfirming evidence.

This study explored the determination of damages by jury-eligible citizens and trial court judges. 140 jury-eligible citizens (mean age 28.2 yrs) and 87 federal and state trial court judges (mean age 51 yrs) read a hypothetical vignette and responded to a series of questions. The punitive damage awards of both groups were of similar magnitude and variability. The compensatory damages of jurors were marginally lower but, in some conditions, were more variable than the compensatory damage awards of judges. Both groups appropriately utilized information about both the actual and potential severity of the harm to the plaintiff in determining punitive damages and used only the actual severity of the injury in determining compensatory damages. The punitive damage awards of both groups were influenced by the wealth of the defendant, but the compensatory damage awards of judges were marginally more influenced by defendant wealth than those of citizens.

The results showed that golfers largely maintained performance, but that distance control of the shortest shots deteriorated when preparation was disrupted. Cluster analysis indicated that interference to short-shot preparation elicited a similar number of cognitive mistakes (e.g. poor decision-making) and execution mistakes (e.g. poor timing).

9,1314,2,"Objective: To determine how professional characteristics and practices of physicians alter the selection of medical treatments involving multiple alternatives. Situations involving multiple alternatives can increase the difficulty of making a decision, resulting in more choice deferral than when fewer alternatives are available. Design, Setting, Participants: A survey and scenario were mailed to a random sample of 314 primary and emergency care physicians affiliated with the Indiana University Medical Center. Using a scenario involving treatment decisions for a patient with osteoarthritis, the effects of multiple treatment alternatives on decision making were explored. Other physician factors included experience, workload, fatigue, continuing education, and supervision. Main Outcome Measures: Physicians' treatment decisions. Results: Physician response was 61% (n=192). In contrast to previous studies, physicians in the present study were equally likely to prescribe a new medication, regardless of whether they were deciding about 1 medication or between 2 similar medications (54.5% v. 56.0%, P=0.841). However, physicians who supervise medical students were far less influenced by the cognitive bias associated with multiple choices than those who did not supervise medical students. Supervising physicians were more likely to defer making a decision when there was only 1 treatment option than when there were 2 (49.3% v. 37%, P=0.143), whereas the opposite was true for nonsupervising physicians (33.3% v. 63%, P=0.040). The number of hours spent supervising medical students and the number of years as a physician were also important factors in the decision-making process. Conclusions: Multiple treatment alternatives may result in a deferral of choice. However, this cognitive bias is attenuated by experience and supervision, thus enhancing decision making. Implicit and explicit learning gained through experience and the supervisory process appears to be a central mechanism by which the physicians are protected from this cognitive bias.

Multiple regression analysis was used to model the likelihood of speaking up as outcome of vignette attributes, responder's evaluations of the situation and personal characteristics.Results: Respondents reported a high likelihood of speaking up about patient safety but the variation between and within types of errors and rule violations was substantial. Staff without managerial function provided significantly higher levels of decision difficulty and discomfort to speak up. Based on the information presented in the vignettes, 74%-96% would speak up towards a supervisor failing to check a prescription, 45%-81% would point a coworker to a missed hand disinfection, 82%-94% would speak up towards nurses who violate a safety rule in medication preparation, and 59%-92% would question a doctor violating a safety rule in lumbar puncture. Several vignette attributes predicted the likelihood of speaking up. Perceived potential harm, anticipated discomfort, and decision difficulty were significant predictors of the likelihood of speaking up.Conclusions: Clinicians' willingness to speak up about patient safety is considerably affected by contextual factors.

Two explanations are consistent with the data. One, subjects behave as if their utility function incorporates a preference to reduce ex-post inventory error, the absolute difference between the chosen quantity and realized demand.

9,1324,9,"Human error is believed to contribute to the majority of negative anesthesia outcomes. Because retrospective analysis of critical incidents has several shortcomings and prospective studies are limited by the low frequency of critical incidents, an anesthesia simulator was used to evaluate the management of simulated emergency situations by ten anesthesia residents, ten faculty anesthesiologists, and ten anesthesiologists in private practice in order to identify specific patterns of errors in diagnosis and treatment. The simulator is a computer program that presents the patient, monitors, and management choices in a graphical display on an IBM or compatible personal computer. Many errors were observed in the management of these emergency situations, and even anesthesiologists with years of experience made serious errors. Although all experienced anesthesiologists correctly diagnosed simulated esophageal intubation, two residents misinterpreted the lack of end-tidal carbon dioxide. Only 40% of subjects correctly diagnosed simulated anaphylactic reaction; 27% adequately treated simulated myocardial ischemia; and 30% managed a simulated cardiac arrest according to Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines. Problems with continuous infusions of vasoactive agents were common. Fixation errors or failure to revise a plan in the presence of inconsistent cues were made by 63% of subjects. The subjects that gathered more information during simulated anaphylaxis made the correct diagnosis more often and made fewer treatment errors. The time since the last ACLS training was found to be an important predictor of correct management of simulated cardiac arrest. Whereas 71% of those trained within the last 6 months managed simulated resuscitations successfully, successful management was decreased to about 30% by those whose ACLS training occurred from 6 months to 2 yr earlier, and no subject who had trained in ACLS longer than 2 yr prior to evaluation successfully followed ACLS guidelines. Based on the retention of ACLS protocols during the management of simulated cardiac arrest, anesthesiologists should review the management of emergency situations such as cardiac arrest, anaphylaxis, myocardial ischemia, and malignant hyperthermia every 6 months to maintain the appropriate skill level.",SCHWID,1992,ANESTHESIOLOGISTS MANAGEMENT OF SIMULATED CRITICAL INCIDENTS,ANESTHESIOLOGY,76,495,501,Web of Science,"SCHWID, HA; ODONNELL, D"
9,1325,4,"Background: Surveys of doctors are an important data collection method in health services research. Ways to improve response rates, minimise survey response bias and item non-response, within a given budget, have not previously been addressed in the same study. The aim of this paper is to compare the effects and costs of three different modes of survey administration in a national survey of doctors.Methods: A stratified random sample of 4.9% (2,702/54,160) of doctors undertaking clinical practice was drawn from a national directory of all doctors in Australia. Stratification was by four doctor types: general practitioners, specialists, specialists-in-training, and hospital non-specialists, and by six rural/remote categories. A three-arm parallel trial design with equal randomisation across arms was used. Doctors were randomly allocated to: online questionnaire (902); simultaneous mixed mode (a paper questionnaire and login details sent together) (900); or, sequential mixed mode (online followed by a paper questionnaire with the reminder) (900). Analysis was by intention to treat, as within each primary mode, doctors could choose either paper or online. Primary outcome measures were response rate, survey response bias, item non-response, and cost.Results: The online mode had a response rate 12.95%, followed by the simultaneous mixed mode with 19.7%, and the sequential mixed mode with 20.7%. After adjusting for observed differences between the groups, the online mode had a 7 percentage point lower response rate compared to the simultaneous mixed mode, and a 7.7 percentage point lower response rate compared to sequential mixed mode. The difference in response rate between the sequential and simultaneous modes was not statistically significant. Both mixed modes showed evidence of response bias, whilst the characteristics of online respondents were similar to the population. However, the online mode had a higher rate of item non-response compared to both mixed modes. The total cost of the online survey was 38% lower than simultaneous mixed mode and 22% lower than sequential mixed mode. The cost of the sequential mixed mode was 14% lower than simultaneous mixed mode. Compared to the online mode, the sequential mixed mode was the most cost-effective, although exhibiting some evidence of response bias.Conclusions: Decisions on which survey mode to use depend on response rates, response bias, item non-response and costs. The sequential mixed mode appears to be the most cost-effective mode of survey administration for surveys of the population of doctors, if one is prepared to accept a degree of response bias.

9,1326,4,"Researchers generally engage in few interactions with policymakers, which limits the extent to which empirical evidence is used to guide public policy and, consequently, the potential effectiveness of public policies in improving societal wellbeing. Although many researchers wish to see their work used for social impact, several factors contribute to researchers’ limited policy engagement, including a lack of opportunities for developing policy competencies (i.e., knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy that support effective policy engagement) and limited support or incentives from research, training, and philanthropic institutions. Moreover, despite work that shows that researchers are more likely to engage in policy when they report greater policy competencies, little descriptive or evaluative research has explored the effectiveness of policy training. The current work seeks to expand the limited empirical base by drawing connections between training approaches and conditions that support policymakers’ use of research evidence. Policy training approaches that combine direct instruction (i.e., information-based, often didactic teaching via classes) and experiential learning (i.e., skills and knowledge obtained through active engagement, hands-on application) appear most promising. Various pathways for policy training are described, and one specific policy training and engagement strategy is further described alongside evaluation data regarding benefits associated with direct instruction and experiential learning approaches. We conclude with recommendations to strengthen researchers’ policy competency development and engagement. These recommendations range from increasing access to training opportunities to adjusting institutional incentive systems that currently hinder researchers’ policy engagement.

9,1329,4,"Background and aims: There are scant data on how doctors approach seizures in the acute setting. We sought to study (a) exposure to seizure disorders as well as relevant training and (b) reactions to seizures in the acute setting, among medical residents undergoing physician training.Methods: The exposure to and training on seizure disorders were assessed using a structured questionnaire first. Then, they were tested with 20 videos consisting of 10 epileptic seizures (ESs) and 10 psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs). After each video, we asked three questions to test (a) the diagnosis and the practice of administration of benzodiazepines to terminate the seizure, (b) the estimation of seizure duration, and (c) the practice of intubation. The accuracy of diagnosis was measured by the area under the summary receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). The difference between true seizure duration and estimated duration was evaluated using paired-sample t-test.Results: A total of 48 trainees participated in the study. The majority witnessed seizures inmovies (37, 77.1%) and television (35, 72.9%). Only 12 (25%) received bedside teaching on seizure disorders. Their diagnostic accuracy of seizures was very poor (AUC = 0.54). Participants significantly underestimated the duration of seizures. Thirty-five doctors made an illogical decision to intubate but not to terminate the seizure with intravenous benzodiazepine.Conclusions: The diagnostic accuracy of seizures is poor among trainees, and their estimates of seizure duration are unreliable.

Investigators reported using colleagues more often than professional interpreters, using interpreters more often with suspects and in certain crimes (e.g., domestic violence), and that interpreters are usually at least partially informed about case facts prior to translating. Investigators responded to experimental vignettes, and results indicated they were more likely to seek and obtain interpreters when an interviewee has lived in the United States for fewer years; however, the language spoken and the interviewee's role (e.g., witness vs. suspect) did not affect decisions to request an interpreter.

9,1333,4,"Purpose This paper aims to clarify the mechanism by which heuristics influences the investment decisions of individual investors, actively trading on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), and the perceived efficiency of the market. Most studies focus on well-developed financial markets and very little is known about investors' behaviour in less developed financial markets or emerging markets. The present study contributes to filling this gap in the literature.Design/methodology/approach Investors' heuristic biases have been measured using a questionnaire, containing numerous items, including indicators of speculators, investment decisions and perceived market efficiency variables. The sample consists of 143 investors trading on the PSX. A convenient, purposively sampling technique was used for data collection. To examine the relationship between heuristic biases, investment decisions and perceived market efficiency, hypotheses were tested by using correlation and regression analysis.Findings The paper provides empirical insights into the relationship of heuristic biases, investment decisions and perceived market efficiency. The results suggest that heuristic biases (overconfidence, representativeness, availability and anchoring) have a markedly negative impact on investment decisions made by individual investors actively trading on the PSX and on perceived market efficiency.Research limitations/implications The primary limitation of the empirical review is the tiny size of the sample. A larger sample would have given more trustworthy results and could have empowered a more extensive scope of investigation.Practical implications The paper encourages investors to avoid relying on heuristics or their feelings when making investments. It provides awareness and understanding of heuristic biases in investment management, which could be very useful for decision makers and professionals in financial institutions, such as portfolio managers and traders in commercial banks, investment banks and mutual funds. This paper helps investors to select better investment tools and avoid repeating expensive errors, which occur due to heuristic biases. They can improve their performance by recognizing their biases and errors of judgment, to which we are all prone, resulting in a more efficient market. So, it is necessary to focus on a specific investment strategy to control mental mistakes by investors, due to heuristic biases.Originality/value The current study is the first of its kind, focusing on the link between heuristics, individual investment decisions and perceived market efficiency within the specific context of Pakistan.",Shah,2018,Heuristic biases in investment decision-making and perceived market efficiency: A survey at the Pakistan stock exchange,QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS,10,85,110,Web of Science,"Shah, Syed Zulfiqar Ali; Ahmad, Maqsood; Mahmood, Faisal"
9,1334,9,"Background and aims: Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs towards low back pain (LBP) can significantly impact a health care provider's clinical decision making. Several studies have investigated interventions designed to change practitioner attitudes and beliefs towards LBP, however no such studies involving medical students have been identified.Methods: This study explored medical students' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs towards LBP before and after a brief educational intervention on LBP. Responses from medical students (n = 93) were evaluated before and after a 15-min educational video on back pain. The intervention was developed using Camtasia (TM) video editor and screen recorder. Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs were measured using the ""Modified Back Beliefs Questionnaire"", with items from two previously reported questionnaires on back beliefs. The questionnaire asks participants to indicate their agreement with statements about LBP on a 5-point Likert scale. Preferred responses were based on guidelines for the evidence-based management of LBP. The primary analysis evaluated total score on the nine-inevitability items of the Back Beliefs Questionnaire (""inevitability score"").Results: Following the brief intervention there was a significant improvement in the inevitability score (post-workshop mean [SD] 20.8 [4.9] vs pre-workshop mean [SD] 26.9 [4.2]; mean difference (MD) 6.1, p < 0.001; lower score more favourable1) and large improvements in the proportion of students providing correct responses to items on activity (pre: 49% vs post: 79%), bed rest (41% vs 75%), imaging (44% vs 74%) and recovery (25% vs 66%).Conclusions: After watching the educational video students' knowledge, beliefs and attitudes towards LBP improved and thus aligned more closely with evidence-based guidelines.Implications: Medical doctors are at the forefront of managing low back pain in the community, however there is a need to strengthen musculoskeletal education in medical training programmes. The results from this research suggest educational interventions on back pain do not need to be extensive in order to have favourable outcomes on medical students' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs towards back pain.

Methods: A questionnaire-based survey conducted in the campus of a university in Hong Kong. Preferences and priorities of participants on cardiopulmonary resuscitation in various situations and case scenarios, experience of death and dying, prior knowledge of DNR and basic demographic data were evaluated. Results: A total of 766 students participated in the study. There were statistically significant differences in their DNR decisions in various situations between medical and non-medical students, clinical and preclinical students, and between students who had previously experienced death and dying and those who had not. A prior knowledge of DNR significantly affected DNR decision, although 66.4% of non-medical students and 18.7% of medical students had never heard of DNR. 74% of participants from both medical and non-medical fields considered the patient's own wish as the most important factor that the healthcare team should consider when making DNR decisions. Family wishes might not be decisive on the choice of DNR. Conclusions: Students in medical and non-medical fields held different views on DNR.

Background: While previous studies have indicated that team simulations may improve ethics in the workplace by reducing the number of errors, those studies focused mainly on clinical aspects and not on nurses’ ethical experiences or on the benefits of authentic leadership. Methods: Fifty nurses from 10 health institutions in central Israel participated in the study. Data about nurses’ ethical experiences were collected from 10 teams. Qualitative data analysis based on Grounded Theory was applied, using the ATLAS. TI 5.0 software package. Findings: Simulation findings suggest four main benefits that reflect the underlying components of authentic leadership: self‐awareness, relational transparency, balanced information processing and internalized moral perspective. Conclusions: Team‐based simulation as a training tool may lead to authentic leadership among nurses. Implications for nursing management: Nursing management should incorporate team simulations into nursing practice to help resolve power conflicts and to develop authentic leadership in nursing.

9,1340,4,"Introduction: Observation, including identification of key pieces of data, pattern recognition, and interpretation of significance and meaning, is a key element in medical decision making. Clinical observation is taught primarily through preceptor modelling during the all-important clinical years. No single method exists for communicating these skills, and medical educators have periodically experimented with using arts-based training to hone observational acuity. The purpose of this qualitative study was to better understand the similarities and differences between arts-based and clinical teaching approaches to convey observation and pattern recognition skills. Method: A total of 38 Year 3 students participated in either small group training with clinical photographs and paper cases (group 1), or small group training using art plus dance (group 2), both consisting of 3 2-hour sessions over a 6-month period. Findings: Students in both conditions found value in the training they received and, by both self- and instructor-report, appeared to hone observation skills and improve pattern recognition. The clinically based condition appeared to have been particularly successful in conveying pattern recognition concepts to students, probably because patterns presented in this condition had specific correspondence with actual clinical situations, whereas patterns in art could not be generalised so easily to patients. In the arts-based conditions, students also developed skills in emotional recognition, cultivation of empathy, identification of story and narrative, and awareness of multiple perspectives. Conclusion: The interventions studied were naturally complementary and, taken together, can bring greater texture to the process of teaching clinical medicine by helping us see a more complete 'picture' of the patient.

Mock jurors who had taken the course were compared with those who had not. Both groups were shown a videotape of a rape trial and participated in jury deliberations. Jurors trained in psycholegal knowledge voted for acquittal more often than those who were not. Additionally, trained jurors were more satisfied, were more confident that their jury reached a correct verdict, and believed more that their jury's decision was based on the evidence presented than did untrained jurors. Content analysis of jury deliberations found that trained jurors were more task oriented and focused on relevant evidence than untrained jurors.

,1344,2,"There is an ongoing debate regarding the cause of diagnostic errors. One view is that errors result from unconscious application of cognitive heuristics; the alternative is that errors are a consequence of knowledge deficits.

Novice postgraduate year (PGY) 1 emergency medicine and internal medicine residents (n = 40) and experienced cardiology fellows (PGY 4-6) (n = 21) were randomly allocated to three conditions: a debiasing checklist, a content (knowledge) checklist, or control (no checklist) to be used while interpreting 20 ECGs. Half of the ECGs were deliberately engineered to predispose to bias. Diagnostic performance under either checklist intervention was not significantly better than the control. As expected, more errors occurred when cases were designed to induce bias (F = 96.9, p < 0.0001). There was no significant interaction between the instructional condition and level of learner. Checklists attempting to help learners identify cognitive bias or mobilize domain-specific knowledge did not have an overall effect in reducing diagnostic errors in ECG interpretation, although they may help novices.

9,1346,4,"Purpose This paper aims to deal with expert judgment and its predictive ability in the context of investment funds. The judgmental ratings awarder with a large set of experts was compared to a sample of the dynamic investment funds operating in Central and Eastern Europe with their objective performance, both past and future, relatively to the time of the forecast. Design/methodology/approach Data on the survey sample enabled the authors to evaluate both ex post judgmental validity, i.e. how the experts reflected the previous performance of funds, and ex ante predictive accuracy, i.e. how well their judgments estimated the future performance of the fund. For this purpose, logistic regression for past values estimations and linear model for future values estimations was used. Findings It was found that the experts (independent academicians, senior bank specialists and senior financial advisors) were only able to successfully reflect past annual returns of a five-year period, failing to reflect costs and annual volatility and, mainly, failing to predict any of the indicators on the same five-year horizon. Practical implications - The outcomes of this paper confirm that expert judgment should be used with caution in the context of financial markets and mainly in situations when domain knowledge is applicable. Procedures incorporating judgmental evaluations, such as individual investment advice, should be thoroughly reviewed in terms of client value-added, to eliminate potential anchoring bias. Originality/value This paper sheds new light on the quality and nature of individual judgment produced by financial experts. These are prevalent in many situations influencing clients' decision-making, be it financial advice or multiple product contests. As such, our findings underline the need of scepticism when these judgments are taken into account.",Sindelar,2019,Evaluating the quality of investment products: can expert judgment outsmart the market?,FORESIGHT,21,497,507,Web of Science,"Sindelar, Jiri; Svoboda, Martin"
9,1347,4,"Objective: Diagnostic errors in primary care are harmful but poorly studied. To facilitate the understanding of diagnostic errors in real-world primary care settings that use electronic health records (EHRs), this study explored the use of the situational awareness (SA) framework from aviation human factors research.Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted involving reviews of EHR data followed by semi-structured interviews of selected providers from two institutions in the USA. The study population included 380 consecutive patients with colorectal and lung cancers diagnosed between February 2008 and January 2009. Using a pre-tested data collection instrument, trained physicians identified diagnostic errors, defined as lack of timely action on one or more established indications for diagnostic work-up for lung and colorectal cancers. Twenty-six providers involved in cases with and without errors were interviewed. Interviews probed for providers' lack of SA and how this may have influenced the diagnostic process.Results: Of 254 cases meeting inclusion criteria, errors were found in 30 of 92 (32.6%) lung cancer cases and 56 of 167 (33.5%) colorectal cancer cases. Analysis of interviews related to error cases revealed evidence of lack of one of four levels of SA applicable to primary care practice: information perception, information comprehension, forecasting future events, and choosing appropriate action based on the first three levels. In cases without error, application of the SA framework provided insight into processes involved in attention management.Conclusions: A framework of SA can help analyse and understand diagnostic errors in primary care settings that use EHRs.",Singh,2012,Exploring situational awareness in diagnostic errors in primary care,BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY,21,30,38,Web of Science,"Singh, Hardeep; Giardina, Traber Davis; Petersen, Laura A.; Smith, Michael W.; Paul, Lindsey Wilson; Dismukes, Key; Bhagwath, Gayathri; Thomas, Eric J."

9,1350,9,"Persons experiencing serious mental illness (SMI) report feeling marginalized by health care providers, receive health care services at alarmingly lower rates, receive poorer quality of services, and experience higher mortality rates when compared to non-SMI populations. Providers’ negative attitudes may be 1 contributing factor, as they have been found to affect providers’ clinical intentions. This study compared provider attitudes toward individuals with schizophrenia across 5 different Veterans Affairs (VA) health care provider groups to identify targets for antistigma interventions. Two clinical vignettes (schizophrenia vs. no schizophrenia) that varied only in history of schizophrenia were distributed to 5 provider groups (primary care physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care and mental health nurses) employed by VA hospitals in the south-central United States. Each provider read 1 of the 2 vignettes before completing short surveys assessing attitudes (stereotype, social distance, and attribution of mental illness) toward the vignette patient. Responses of 351 providers were compared on these 3 attitudes. Primary care physicians, primary care nurses, and psychiatrists exhibited more negative attitudes toward persons with schizophrenia when compared to mental health nurses and psychologists. In addition, primary care physicians, primary care nurses, and psychiatrists held more negative beliefs about persons with schizophrenia when compared to those without schizophrenia. These findings identify how various provider groups may differ in their stigmatizing attitudes and can inform future antistigma programs focused on changing provider attitudes toward individuals with SMI, thereby improving the quality of health care provided.

9,1351,4,"Objectives: To provide information on the frequency and reasons for outcome reporting bias in clinical trials. Design: Trial protocols were compared with subsequent publication(s) to identify any discrepancies in the outcomes reported, and telephone interviews were conducted with the respective trialists to investigate more extensively the reporting of the research and the issue of unreported outcomes. Participants: Chief investigators, or lead or coauthors of trials, were identified from two sources: trials published since 2002 covered in Cochrane systematic reviews where at least one trial analysed was suspected of being at risk of outcome reporting bias (issue 4, 2006; issue 1, 2007, and issue 2, 2007 of the Cochrane library); and a random sample of trial reports indexed on PubMed between August 2007 and July 2008. Setting: Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Main outcome measures: Frequency of incomplete outcome reporting—signified by outcomes that were specified in a trial’s protocol but not fully reported in subsequent publications—and trialists’ reasons for incomplete reporting of outcomes. Results: 268 trials were identified for inclusion (183 from the cohort of Cochrane systematic reviews and 85 from PubMed). Initially, 161 respective investigators responded to our requests for interview, 130 (81%) of whom agreed to be interviewed. However, failure to achieve subsequent contact, obtain a copy of the study protocol, or both meant that final interviews were conducted with 59 (37%) of the 161 trialists. Sixteen trial investigators failed to report analysed outcomes at the time of the primary publication, 17 trialists collected outcome data that were subsequently not analysed, and five trialists did not measure a prespecified outcome over the course of the trial. In almost all trials in which prespecified outcomes had been analysed but not reported (15/16, 94%), this under-reporting resulted in bias. In nearly a quarter of trials in which prespecified outcomes had been measured but not analysed (4/17, 24%), the “direction” of the main findings influenced the investigators’ decision not to analyse the remaining data collected. In 14 (67%) of the 21 randomly selected PubMed trials, there was at least one unreported efficacy or harm outcome. More than a quarter (6/21, 29%) of these trials were found to have displayed outcome reporting bias. Conclusion: The prevalence of incomplete outcome reporting is high. Trialists seemed generally unaware of the implications for the evidence base of not reporting all outcomes and protocol changes.

9,1352,4,"Objective: To determine the most accurate technique to measure the heart rate during atrial fibrillation by use of three counting intervals, 15, 30, and 60 seconds, and two methods, apical and radial pulse measurement.Design: A quasi-experimental, repeated measures factorial design was used to determine absolute error (amount of error ignoring direction of error) between heart rates obtained from six randomly ordered pulse measurements taken of one man in chronic atrial fibrillation by the 94 nurses in the sample and the heart rate recorded by simultaneous electrocardiographic (ECG) and plethysmographic (pleth) recordings.Subjects: Nurses in four groups comprised the sample; registered nurses (N = 29), licensed practical nurses (N = 23), nursing students (N = 21), and registered nurses with advanced degrees who are clinical specialists and in faculty positions.Results: The heart rate of the man varied from 57 to 111 beats/min (mean 81 beats/min). The mean absolute error rates for the six measurements ranged from 8 beats/min to 20 beats/min, all considered to be important when a 10% error was used as the criteria for clinical significance. The apical method was significantly more accurate than the radial method regardless of whether the ECG or pleth standard was used (ECG - F1,90 = 72.91, p < 0.0001; pleth - F1,144 = 4.68, p = 0.036). The 60-second counting interval was significantly more accurate regardless of the standard (ECG - F2,180 = 5.19, p = 0.006; pleth - F2,88 = 3.95, p = 0.02).Conclusions: Atrial fibrillation occurs in 2% to 4% of people over 60 years of age and is one of the most difficult dysrhythmias to count. Accurate counts are important when making clinical decisions, yet measurement of heart rate in this study was quite inaccurate.

,1353,2,"PURPOSE: To assess healthcare provider accuracy in recognizing the physical examination findings of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) and technical competence in performing tympanocentesis using a simulation model.DATA SOURCES: A descriptive study of 1,271 pediatricians and 206 nurse practitioners (NPs) who viewed 9 different video-recorded pneumatic otoscopic examinations of tympanic membranes (TMs) during a continuing medical education (CME) course. Diagnostic differentiation of AOM, OME and normal was ascertained. A mannequin model of a one-two year old child was used to assess technical proficiency of performing tympanocentesis on artificial tympanic membranes.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the average correct diagnosis by all healthcare providers was 46% (range = 25% to 71%); by pediatricians it was 50% (25% to 71%) and by NPs 42% (25% to 68%). Pediatricians and NPs correctly recognized the absence of normality 86% to 99% and 68% to 99% of the time; they over-diagnosed AOM in 7% to 58% (average 27%) and 10% to 65% of examinations (average 31%), respectively. Performance of tympanocentesis was optimally performed by 73% of NPs.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The distinction between AOM and OME is important for antibiotic management decisions; tympanocentesis may be useful in diagnosis of AOM in selected patients. Healthcare providers may misdiagnose AOM and OME with some frequency. Nurse practitioners and pediatricians have the skills to be trained in the tympanocentesis procedure.

9,1357,9,"Accuracy of speech recognizer decisions is an important criterion for maintaining both system effectiveness and user satisfaction. A central-composite design methodology is recommended as an economical means to develop empirical prediction equations for speech recognizer performance incorporating a number of influential factors. Factors manipulated in the central-composite design included number of training passes, reject threshold, difference score, and size of the active vocabulary. The factorial combination of two noncontinuous variables, sex of the speaker and inter-word confusability, was also investigated by replicating the central-composite design to create four sets of data. Standard least-squares multiple regression analysis was used to develop the four sets of prediction equations, each of which accounted for at least 50% of the variance in recognizer performance. A cross-validation study revealed that shrinkage was not excessive. Subsequently, these empirical models were incorporated into an interactive design tooi for a dialogue author where the percentage of correct recognition is automatically optimized when the dialogue author enters the size of the vocabulary to be used or both the vocabulary size and desired number of training passes. The design tooi can also be used to make predictions anywhere within the response surface.

9,1358,4,"Objectives. The aims of the present study were to investigate doctors' attitudes regarding the discussion and writing of not for resuscitation (NFR) orders and to identify potential barriers to the completion of these orders.Methods. A questionnaire-based convenience study was undertaken at a tertiary hospital. Likert scales and open-ended questions were directed to issues surrounding the discussion, timing, understanding and writing of NFR orders, including legal and personal considerations.Results. Doctors thought the presence of an NFR order both should and does alter care delivered by nursing staff, particularly delivery of pain relief, nursing observations and contacting the medical emergency team. Eighty-five per cent of doctors believed they needed somebody else's consent to write an NFR order (seeking of consent is not a requirement in most Australian jurisdictions).Conclusion. There are complex barriers to the writing and implementation of NFR orders, including doctors' knowledge around the need for consent when cardiopulmonary resuscitation is likely to be futile or excessively burdensome. Doctors also believed that NFR orders result in changes to goals-of-care, suggesting a confounding of NFR orders with palliative care. Furthermore, doctors are willing to write NFR orders where there is clear medical indication and the patient is imminently dying, but are otherwise reliant on patients and family to initiate discussion.What is known about the topic? Hospitalised elderly patients, in the absence of an NFR order, are known to have poor survival and outcomes following resuscitation. Further, Australian data on the prevalence of NFR forms show that only a minority of older in-patients have a written NFR order in their history. In Australian hospitals, NFR orders are completed by doctors.What does this paper add? To our knowledge, the present study is the first in Australia to qualitatively analyse doctors' reasons to writing NFR orders. The open-text nature of this questioning has been important in eliciting doctors' responses without hypothesis guessing bias. Further, we add to the literature on the breadth of considerations doctors may encounter with regard to NFR orders.What are the implications for practitioners? The findings indicate the issues impeding decision making around cardiopulmonary resuscitation relate to poor knowledge of the law, particularly around the issue of consent and confounding NFR orders with provision of palliative care. Such barriers to the completion of NFR orders expose elderly in-patients to futile and burdensome resuscitation events. The findings suggest consideration be given to education and training materials to inform doctors about jurisdictional law regarding resuscitation documentation, support decision making around cardiopulmonary resuscitation and promote goals-of-care discussions on admission.",Sritharan,2017,Doctors' attitudes regarding not for resuscitation orders,AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW,41,680,687,Web of Science,"Sritharan, Gaya; Mills, Amber C.; Levinson, Michele R.; Gellie, Anthea L."

9,1361,4,"Moving and acting underwater within recreational or occupational activities require intact executive functions, since they subserve higher cognitive functions such as successful self-regulation, coping with novel situations, and decision making; all of which could be influenced by nitrogen narcosis due to elevated partial pressure under water. However, specific executive functions that could provide a differentiated view on humans' cognitive performance ability have not yet been systematically analyzed in full-water immersion, which is a research gap addressed within this approach to contribute to a better understanding of nitrogen narcosis. In this study, 20 young, healthy, and certified recreational divers participated and performed three different executive-function tests: the Stroop test (Inhibition), the Number/Letter test (Task switching), the 2-back test (Updating/Working memory), and a simple reaction time test (Psychomotor performance). These tests were performed once on land, at 5-meter (m) water depth, and at 20-meter (m) water depth of an indoor diving facility in standardized test conditions (26 degrees C in all water depths). A water-proofed and fully operational tablet computer was used to present visual stimuli and to register reaction times. Performance of the simple reaction time test was not different between underwater and land testing, suggesting that reaction times were not biased by the utilization of the tablet in water immersion. Executive functions were not affected by the shallow water immersion of 5-m water depth. However, performance scores in 20-m water depth revealed a decreased performance in the incongruent test condition (i.e., an index of inhibitory control ability) of the Stroop test, while all other tests were unaffected. Even though only one out of the three tested cognitive domains was affected, the impairment of inhibitory control ability even in relatively shallow water of 20-m is a critical component that should be considered for diver's safety, since inhibition is required in self-control requiring situations where impulsive and automatic behavior must be inhibited. Our interpretation of these selective impairments is based on a discussion suggesting that different neural networks within the central nervous system, which process specific executive functions, are affected differently by nitrogen narcosis.",Steinberg,2017,Executive Functions of Divers Are Selectively Impaired at 20-Meter Water Depth,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,8,,,Web of Science,"Steinberg, Fabian; Doppelmayr, Michael"
9,1362,4,"In visual inspection tasks, such as airport security and medical screening, researchers often use the detection measures d' or A' to analyze detection performance independent of response tendency. However, recent studies that manipulated the frequency of targets (target prevalence) indicate that d(a) with a slope parameter of 0.6 is more valid for such tasks than d' or A'. We investigated the validity of detection measures (d', A', and d(a)) using two experiments. In the first experiment, 31 security officers completed a simulated X-ray baggage inspection task while response tendency was manipulated directly through instruction. The participants knew half of the prohibited items used in the study from training, whereas the other half were novel, thereby establishing two levels of task difficulty. The results demonstrated that for both levels, d' and A' decreased when the criterion became more liberal, whereas d(a) with a slope parameter of 0.6 remained constant. Eye-tracking data indicated that manipulating response tendency affected the decision component of the inspection task rather than search errors. In the second experiment, 124 security officers completed another simulated X-ray baggage inspection task. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves based on confidence ratings provided further support for d(a), and the estimated slope parameter was 0.5. Consistent with previous findings, our results imply that d' and A' are not valid measures of detection performance in X-ray image inspection.

The authors investigated factors guiding clinical supervisors' decisions to trust residents with critical patient-care tasks. Method: In a mixed quantitative and qualitative descriptive study carried out at University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands, from March to September 2008, the authors surveyed attending anesthetists and resident anesthetists regarding when attendings should entrust each of six selected critical tasks to residents. The authors conducted structured interviews with both groups, using trigger case vignettes to solicit opinions on factors that affect entrustment decisions. Results: Thirty-two attending anesthetists and 31 residents answered the questionnaire (response rate 58%), and 10 participants from each group were interviewed. Attendings varied in their opinions regarding how much independence to give residents, particularly postgraduate year (PGY) 2, 3, and 4 residents. PGY1 residents reported working above their expected level of competence but estimate their own ability as sufficient, whereas PGY5 residents reported working below their expected level of competence. The authors classified factors that determine entrustment into four groups: characteristics of the resident, the attending, the clinical context, and the critical task. Conclusions: Residents' and attendings' opinions and impressions differ regarding what is expected from residents, what residents actually do, and what residents think they can do safely. The authors list factors affecting why and when supervisors trust residents to proceed without supervision.

9,1364,9,"Background. Clinicians' estimates of mortality risk in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) have implications for patient triage, transfer, initiation and termination of life support, and allocation of medical resources. The accuracy of these judgments has not been studied, nor the differences between nurses and attending physicians.Objectives. 1) evaluate the accuracy of subjective judgments of NICU unit mortality risk, 2) identify the key components of clinician judgments, 3) compare accuracy between attending physicians and nurses, and 4) examine the utility of combining an objectively computed risk and clinician judgments to improve predictions.Methods. We obtained estimates of mortality risk on 544 admissions to two NICUs on the day of admission from the attending physician and primary nurse. These were compared with an objective computed mortality risk based on birth weight and the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP) using a linear judgment analysis model, as well as with actual outcomes.Results. Physicians and nurses had good discriminating power with actual mortality rates ranging from 0% among low risk patients to 67% among those with the highest mortality estimates. Physicians had a tendency to overestimate mortality risk. Clinicians base their estimates on the same factors and similar judgment weights as the empiric mortality risk model (22% birth weight, 62% illness severity (SNAP), 13% low Apgar, and 3% for intrauterine growth restriction). Clinicians place additional emphasis on therapeutic as well as physiologic factors. When the computed risk and physician judgment were combined, both made significant contributions in a logistic mortality risk model.Conclusions. Clinician judgments of mortality risk are fairly accurate and similar to an objective illness severity index.

This method creates a conundrum: What happens when a buyer is confronted with conflicting reviews from two different sources? To shed light on this problem, we (1) interviewed 48 B2B buyers, (2) conducted a field experiment with 293 B2B buyers to examine the effect of review source, (3) conducted a second field experiment with 587 B2B buyers to examine the effect of conflicting reviews, and (4) solicited insights from 82 B2B buyers regarding the findings.

9,1367,4,"Objective performance indicators have low test-retest reliability, particularly in complex jobs. Yet, little is actually known about the reasons why objective performance indicators lack temporal stability. The authors address this issue by using data from a sample of 106 professional football players to explore how the actions of other people influence intraindividual variation in performance. Results suggest that weekly measures of performance outcome exhibit substantial variability within individuals. A significant portion of this within-person variance is explained by environmental fluctuation created by the constraining actions of other people. Individuals with highly fluctuating past performance exhibit stronger relationships between the actions of competitors and subsequent performance outcomes. The intraindividual relationship between fluctuating constraints and performance outcomes is also stronger for individuals in more complex jobs.

9,1368,4,"This study explored decision making by child protection social workers in the province of British Columbia, Canada. A factorial survey method was used in which case vignettes were constructed by randomly assigning a number of key characteristics associated with decision making in child protection. Child protection social workers (n = 118) assessed case vignettes (n = 327) for risk, service provision, and importance of client contact. In British Columbia, child protection social workers are expected to make decisions using a risk assessment model. However, as social workers begin to work with clients to facilitate change, relationship factors such as home visits and client contact also become important. The research indicated that social workers made decisions through an integration of objective, procedural, and experiential knowledge. Decisions about risk and service provision were influenced by technocratic knowledge, such as the risk assessment model. Decisions related to the amount of contact with clients and other supportive functions were influenced by individual characteristics of the social workers. The results suggest that in child protection decision making, social workers are moving beyond a reliance on objective tools such as risk assessment to also use internalized subjective knowledge.",Stokes,2012,Child Protection Decision Making: A Factorial Analysis Using Case Vignettes,SOCIAL WORK,57,83,90,Web of Science,"Stokes, Jacqueline; Schmidt, Glen"
9,1369,4,"Diagnostic reasoning is considered to be based on the interaction between analytical and non-analytical cognitive processes. Gut feelings, a specific form of non-analytical reasoning, play a substantial role in diagnostic reasoning by general practitioners (GPs) and may activate analytical reasoning. In GP traineeships in the Netherlands, trainees mostly see patients alone but regularly consult with their supervisors to discuss patients and problems, receive feedback, and improve their competencies. In the present study, we examined the discussions of supervisors and their trainees about diagnostic reasoning in these so-called tutorial dialogues and how gut feelings feature in these discussions. 17 tutorial dialogues focussing on diagnostic reasoning were video-recorded and transcribed and the protocols were analysed using a detailed bottom-up and iterative content analysis and coding procedure. The dialogues were segmented into quotes. Each quote received a content code and a participant code. The number of words per code was used as a unit of analysis to quantitatively compare the contributions to the dialogues made by supervisors and trainees, and the attention given to different topics. The dialogues were usually analytical reflections on a trainee's diagnostic reasoning. A hypothetico-deductive strategy was often used, by listing differential diagnoses and discussing what information guided the reasoning process and might confirm or exclude provisional hypotheses. Gut feelings were discussed in seven dialogues. They were used as a tool in diagnostic reasoning, inducing analytical reflection, sometimes on the entire diagnostic reasoning process. The emphasis in these tutorial dialogues was on analytical components of diagnostic reasoning. Discussing gut feelings in tutorial dialogues seems to be a good educational method to familiarize trainees with non-analytical reasoning.

Data sources: A descriptive correlational survey was conducted among NPs in the United States ( N = 126). Participants were randomly selected from members of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners who had listed a practice site on their application. Conclusions: Sixty-four percent of participants used PDAs. A drug reference was reported to be the most useful and frequently installed application. A large majority of PDA users believed that PDA use supported clinical decision making (91%), promoted patient safety (89%), and increased productivity (75%). Sixty-two percent predicted that PDA use would change their practice within the next 5 years. Implications for practice: As innovative PDA applications with potential to improve patient outcomes become increasingly available, handheld computer skills will be a fundamental practice competency. To prevent errors in clinical decision making with quick access to PDA reference materials, NPs must critically evaluate the legitimacy and worth of PDA software programs. There is a critical need to evaluate the effectiveness of PDA use in clinical settings and develop an evidence base to guide use of the PDA in solving clinical problems.

Results indicate that a mean of 99.7% of protocols contained at least 1 examiner error when studies that included a failure to record examinee responses as an error were combined and a mean of 41.2% of protocols contained at least 1 examiner error when studies that ignored errors of omission were combined. Furthermore, graduate student examiners were significantly more likely to make at least 1 error on Wechsler intelligence test protocols than psychologists. However, psychologists made significantly more errors per protocol than graduate student examiners regardless of the inclusion or exclusion of failure to record examinee responses as errors. On average, 73.1% of Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ) scores changed as a result of examiner errors, whereas 15.8%–77.3% of scores on the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI), Working Memory Index (WMI), and Processing Speed Index changed as a result of examiner errors. In addition, results suggest that examiners tend to overestimate FSIQ scores and underestimate VCI scores. However, no strong pattern emerged for the PRI and WMI. It can be concluded that examiner errors occur frequently and impact index and FSIQ scores. Consequently, current estimates for the standard error of measurement of popular IQ tests may not adequately capture the variance due to the examiner.

Statistics outperformed human judges because they used information optimally and applied decision rules consistently, while clinicians tended to add error variance to their protocol interpretations. Unfortunately, current empirical evidence suggests that the prospects for improving clinicians' consistencies are not promising; the possibility of applying statistical methods to interpreting polygraph data is recommended.

Method: During 2008–2009, using a quasi experimental signal detection design, 63 nursing students and 34 experienced nurses were presented with 25 paper and 25 human simulator ‘cases’ based on real patient records from a single UK National Health Service hospital. Nurses judged whether a simulated case was ‘at risk’ or ‘not at risk’ of a critical event. Clinical judgement performance was measured using standard signal detection measures. Findings: Judgement performance, as measured by hit rates and signal detection ability were significantly lower in higher fidelity clinical simulations. False alarm rates and bias (β) did not differ according to the fidelity of simulation. Clinical experience did not predict the ability to detect risk.

We estimated Ordinary Least Squares regression models to evaluate differences in outcome average visit level of service by patient demographic characteristics described in the clinical scenarios; we adjusted for coders' age, gender, race, and years of coding experience.ResultsThe final analytic sample included 586 respondents who coded at least one clinical scenario. Higher mean level of service was assigned to clinical scenarios describing seniors compared to middle-aged patients in two otherwise identical scenarios, one a patient with type II diabetes mellitus (Coef: 0.28, SE: 0.15) and the other with rheumatoid arthritis (Coef: 0.30, SE: 0.13). Charts describing women were assigned lower level of service than men in patients with asthma exacerbation (Coef: -0.25, SE: 0.13) and rheumatoid arthritis (Coef: -0.20, SE: 0.12). There were no other significant differences in mean complexity score by patient demographics or social needs.ConclusionWe found limited evidence of bias in professional medical coding practice by patient age and gender, though findings were inconsistent across medical conditions. Low levels of observed bias may reflect medical coding workflow and training practices.

9,1391,4,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to establish the optimal decision-making style in a fast-paced, complex, and dynamic environment.Design/methodology/approach - Three decision-making attributes are explored: the use of intuition vs analysis, the proclivity to heuristics, and susceptibility to bias. The intuition/analysis is tested with a questionnaire that has been validated in prior research, while information on the two other dimensions is from an exploratory survey designed for this purpose. Responses to the survey questions provide some insight into the differential decision- making style of elite NHL hockey coaches' vis-a-vis amateur coaches and news reporters.Findings - The data suggest elite decision makers have no preference for intuitive or analytical settings, but exhibit a significantly higher perception of their ability to perform in both. While current literature shows sports athletes to be more intuitive, it appears coaches excel on the analytical dimension instead. This study finds that while elite hockey coaches have fewer biases overall, they tend in particular to be overly optimistic in comparison to amateur coaches and news reporters.Research limitations/implications - The main limitation in this paper is that the survey on heuristics and biases is exploratory, making these results less robust than the findings on intuition and analysis.Originality/value - This paper is first to extend the decision-making literature to coaches, and among few papers that obtain insights from NHL coaches directly. The findings are likely to extend to corporate leadership as well, increasing the relevance of the results.",Trottier,2017,Leading under pressure: evaluating the decision-making style of NHL coaches,SPORT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,7,97,112,Web of Science,"Trottier, Kim"
9,1392,4,"Teamwork is important in medicine, and this includes team-based diagnoses. The influence of communication on diagnostic accuracy in an ambiguous situation was investigated in an emergency medical simulation. The situation was ambiguous in that some of the patient's symptoms suggested a wrong diagnosis. Of 20 groups of physicians, 6 diagnosed the patient, 8 diagnosed with help, and 6 missed the diagnosis. Based on models of decision making, we hypothesized that accurate diagnosis is more likely if groups (a) consider more information, (b) display more explicit reasoning, and (c) talk to the room. The latter two hypotheses were supported. Additional analyses revealed that physicians often failed to report pivotal information after reading in the patient chart. This behavior suggested to the group that the chart contained no critical information. Corresponding to a transactive memory process, this process results in what we call illusory transactive memory. The plausible but incorrect diagnosis implied that the two lungs should sound differently. Despite objectively identical sounds, some physicians did hear a difference, indicating confirmation bias.

9,1396,4,"Individuals’ punishment goals depend on the perceived cause of the misbehavior. However, a corresponding attributional model of punishment goals has only been studied in legal domains—but was largely ignored in others, such as the educational domain, in which student misbehavior is a main stressor for both teachers and students. Thus, we investigated teachers’ punishment goals in classroom settings depending on their attribution of student misbehavior. Specifically, we asked laypeople (Experiment 1), pre-service teachers (Experiment 2), and in-service teachers (Experiment 3) to read several versions of a scenario describing a student destroying the belongings of another student. Using a 2 × 2 within-subjects design, we manipulated the stability (stable vs. unstable) and controllability (controllable vs. uncontrollable) of the cause of the misbehavior. Results show that the support of retribution as a punishment goal in classroom interventions is largely independent of the perceived cause of the misbehavior. By contrast, the support of special prevention (preventing future misbehavior by the offending student) and general prevention (preventing future misbehavior by other students) is primarily subject to the perceived controllability of the misbehavior. Overall, this shows that models of punishment behavior developed in other domains cannot simply be applied to teachers’ classroom intervention strategies.

A total of 49 occupational hygienists from six companies participated in the study and 22 tasks were evaluated. Participating companies provided monitoring data on specific tasks. Information on nine educational and professional experience determinants (e.g. educational background, years of occupational hygiene and exposure assessment experience, professional certifications, statistical training and experience, and the 'need for cognition (NFC)', which is a measure of an individual's motivation for thinking) and four task-specific determinants was also collected from each occupational hygienist. Hygienists had a wide range of educational and professional backgrounds for tasks across a range of industries with different workplace and task characteristics. The American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure assessment strategy was used to make exposure judgments on the probability of the 95th percentile of the underlying exposure distribution being located in one of four exposure categories relative to the occupational exposure limit. After reviewing all available job/task/chemical information, hygienists were asked to provide their judgment in probabilistic terms. Both qualitative (judgments without monitoring data) and quantitative judgments (judgments with monitoring data) were recorded. Ninety-three qualitative judgments and 2142 quantitative judgments were obtained. Data interpretation training, with simple rules of thumb for estimating the 95th percentiles of lognormal distributions, was provided to all hygienists. A data interpretation test (DIT) was also administered and judgments were elicited before and after training. General linear models and cumulative logit models were used to analyze the relationship between accuracy of judgments and the various characteristics describing the participants. Data interpretation training (P < 0.0001), the company that the hygienist worked for (P < 0.0001), the total number of years hygienists had experience doing exposure assessments (P < 0.0001), and professional certifications (P < 0.0001) held by hygienists were found to be significant determinants of accurately predicting the correct exposure category for DITs as well as for task-specific judgment accuracy. Years of experience with a particular task (P < 0.0001), task evaluated, and the number of datapoints used for making judgments were found to be significant predictors of task-specific judgment accuracy. The NFC score was a predictor of the improvement in task judgment accuracy after training. The NFC score was itself predicted by determinants, such as company, years on current job, years of exposure assessment experience, and professional certifications.

Types of medication errors were described. The correlation between several potential risk factors and the occurrence of medication errors was studied to identify potential causes for the errors.Results: In total 2,025 medication administrations to 127 clients were observed. In these administrations 428 errors were observed (21.2%). The most frequently occurring types of errors were use of wrong administration techniques (especially incorrect crushing of medication and not supervising the intake of medication) and wrong time errors (administering the medication at least I h early or late).

The results demonstrated a complementary mediating effect of perceived riskiness between a candidate's qualifications and their selection, and between a candidate's qualifications and their salary offer. In addition, gender moderates the pathway from qualifications to perceived riskiness in that highly qualified women were perceived as less risky for senior leadership than highly qualified men, while moderately qualified women were seen as riskier for senior leadership than moderately qualified men.

9,1402,4,"Background: Physicians who hold medical disability assessment interviews (social insurance physicians) are probably influenced by stereotypes of claimants, especially because they have limited time available and they have to make complicated decisions. Because little is known about the influences of stereotyping on assessment interviews, the objectives of this paper were to qualitatively investigate: (1) the content of stereotypes used to classify claimants with regard to the way in which they communicate; (2) the origins of such stereotypes; (3) the advantages and disadvantages of stereotyping in assessment interviews; and (4) how social insurance physicians minimise the undesirable influences of negative stereotyping.Methods: Data were collected during three focus group meetings with social insurance physicians who hold medical disability assessment interviews with sick-listed employees (i.e. claimants). The participants also completed a questionnaire about demographic characteristics. The data were qualitatively analysed in Atlas.ti in four steps, according to the grounded theory and the principle of constant comparison.Results: A total of 22 social insurance physicians participated. Based on their responses, a claimant's communication was classified with regard to the degree of respect and acceptance in the physician-claimant relationship, and the degree of dominance. Most of the social insurance physicians reported that they classify claimants in general groups, and use these classifications to adapt their own communication behaviour. Moreover, the social insurance physicians revealed that their stereotypes originate from information in the claimants' files and first impressions. The main advantages of stereotyping were that this provides a framework for the assessment interview, it can save time, and it is interesting to check whether the stereotype is correct. Disadvantages of stereotyping were that the stereotypes often prove incorrect, they do not give the complete picture, and the claimant's behaviour changes constantly. Social insurance physicians try to minimise the undesirable influences of stereotypes by being aware of counter transference, making formal assessments, staying neutral to the best of their ability, and being compassionate.Conclusions: We concluded that social insurance physicians adapt their communication style to the degree of respect and dominance of claimants in the physician-claimant relationship, but they try to minimise the undesirable influences of stereotypes in assessment interviews. It is recommended that this issue should be addressed in communication skills training.",van Rijssen,2010,Stereotyping of medical disability claimants' communication behaviour by physicians: towards more focused education for social insurance physicians,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,10,,,Web of Science,"van Rijssen, H.

9,1403,9,"Little has been done to assess veterinarians' moral judgment in relation to animal ethics issues. Following development of the VetDIT, a new moral judgment measure for animal ethics issues, this study aimed to refine and further validate the VetDIT, and to identify effects of teaching interventions on moral judgment and changes in moral judgment over time. VetDIT-V1 was refined into VetDIT-V2, and V3 was developed as a post-intervention test to prevent repetition. To test these versions for comparability, veterinary and animal science students (n = 271) were randomly assigned to complete different versions. The VetDIT discriminates between stages of moral judgment, condensed into three schemas: Personal Interest (PI), Maintaining Norms (MN), and Universal Principles (UP). There were no differences in the scores for MN and UP between the versions, and we equated PI scores to account for differences between versions. Veterinary science students (n = 130) who completed a three-hour small-group workshop on moral development theory and ethical decision making increased their use of UP in moral reasoning, whereas students (n = 271) who received similar information in a 50-minute lecture did not. A longitudinal comparison of matched first-and third-year students (n = 39) revealed no moral judgment development toward greater use of UP. The VetDIT is therefore useful for assessing moral judgment of animal and human ethics issues in veterinary and other animal-related professions. Intensive small-group workshops using moral development knowledge and skills, rather than lectures, are conducive to developing veterinary students' moral judgment.",Verrinder,2015,Assessing Veterinary and Animal Science Students' Moral Judgment Development on Animal Ethics Issues,JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION,42,206,216,Web of Science,"Verrinder, Joy M.; Phillips, Clive J.

9,1414,9,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Education of health care clinicians on racial and ethnic disparities has primarily focused on emphasizing statistics and cultural competency, with minimal attention to racism. Learning about racism and unconscious processes provides skills that reduce bias when interacting with minority patients. This paper describes the responses to a relationship-based workshop and toolkit highlighting issues that medical educators should address when teaching about racism in the context of pernicious health disparities.METHODS: A multiracial, interdisciplinary team identified essential elements of teaching about racism. A 1.5-hour faculty development workshop consisted of a didactic presentation, a 3-minute video vignette depicting racial and gender microaggression within a hospital setting, small group discussion, large group debrief, and presentation of a toolkit.RESULTS: One hundred twenty diverse participants attended the workshop at the 2016 Society of Teachers of Family Medicine Annual Spring Conference. Qualitative information from small group facilitators and large group discussions identified some participants' emotional reactions to the video including dismay, anger, fear, and shame. A pre/postsurvey (N=72) revealed significant changes in attitude and knowledge regarding issues of racism and in participants' personal commitment to address them.DISCUSSION: Results suggest that this workshop changed knowledge and attitudes about racism and health inequities. Findings also suggest this workshop improved confidence in teaching learners to reduce racism in patient care.

An unexpected far domain event was presented on 1 trial per pilot. For flightpath control, there was a benefit for head-up location for conformal, but not for nonconformal symbology. The head-up display viewed over the background eliminated advantages to tracking airspeed and nonconformal symbology that had been present while in the clouds. Head-up display also produced a slower response to the far domain unexpected event. The results are interpreted within the theoretical framework of object-based and space-based theories of visual attention, and the tradeoffs between clutter of overlapping imagery and information access cost. These are incorporated in a processing model that can guide the appropriate choice of symbology for head-up displays.

9,1416,4,"Research suggests stereotyping by clinicians as one contributor to racial and gender-based health disparities. It is necessary to understand the origins of such biases before interventions can be developed to eliminate them. As a first step toward this understanding, we tested for the presence of bias in senior medical students.The purpose of the study was to determine whether bias based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status influenced clinical decision-making among medical students.We surveyed seniors at 84 medical schools, who were required to choose between two clinically equivalent management options for a set of cardiac patient vignettes. We examined variations in student recommendations based on patient race, gender, and socioeconomic status.The study included senior medical students.We investigated the percentage of students selecting cardiac procedural options for vignette patients, analyzed by patient race, gender, and socioeconomic status.Among 4,603 returned surveys, we found no evidence in the overall sample supporting racial or gender bias in student clinical decision-making. Students were slightly more likely to recommend cardiac procedural options for black (43.9 %) vs. white (42 %, p = .03) patients; there was no difference by patient gender. Patient socioeconomic status was the strongest predictor of student recommendations, with patients described as having the highest socioeconomic status most likely to receive procedural care recommendations (50.3 % vs. 43.2 % for those in the lowest socioeconomic status group, p < .001). Analysis by subgroup, however, showed significant regional geographic variation in the influence of patient race and gender on decision-making. Multilevel analysis showed that white female patients were least likely to receive procedural recommendations.In the sample as a whole, we found no evidence of racial or gender bias in student clinical decision-making.

Goal-focused coaching is based on goal-setting theory, which concentrates on identifying a task to be accomplished, whereas process-oriented coaching emphasizes interpersonal processes more than specific content or goals. Sixty-four senior executives and their supervisors (dyads) from a multibillion-dollar company were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (a) goal-focused coaching, (b) process-oriented coaching, (c) goal-focused control group, and (d) process-oriented control group. Participants and their supervisors each chose 1 of 8 leadership competencies from the organization’s performance-management system as the coaching objective. The coaching consisted of 4 face-to-face, 1-hr coaching sessions over a 4- to 6-week period. The 16 executive coaches in the study received precoaching training to ensure consistent delivery of the two approaches. The results showed an increase in leadership competencies and behaviors for the coaching groups but not for the control groups, as rated by the coachees only. Contrary to prediction, however, there was no significant difference between the approaches of goal-focused and process-oriented coaching on leadership competencies or behaviors. Furthermore, there were no differences between the two approaches in the postcoaching follow-up. Implications of the results for executive-coaching theory, research, and practice are discussed.

,1419,2,"Aim: The aim of this study was to establish if postregistration education and clinical experience influence nurses' knowledge of pain. Background: Inadequacies in the pain management process may not be tied to myth and bias originating from general attitudes and beliefs, but reflect inadequate pain knowledge. Design: A pain knowledge survey of 20 true/false statements was used to measure the knowledge base of two groups of nurses. This was incorporated in a self-administered questionnaire that also addressed lifestyle factors of patients in pain, inferences of physical pain, general attitudes and beliefs about pain management. Method: One hundred questionnaires were distributed; 86 nurses returned the questionnaire giving a response rate of 86%. Following selection of the sample, 72 nurses participated in the study: 35 hospice/oncology nurses (specialist) and 37 district nurses (general). Data were analysed using SPSS. Results: The specialist nurses had a more comprehensive knowledge base than the general nurses; however, their knowledge scores did not appear to be related to their experience in terms of years within the nursing profession. Conclusion: Whilst educational programmes contribute to an increase in knowledge, it would appear that the working environment has an influence on the development and use of this knowledge. It is suggested that the clinical environment in which the specialist nurse works can induce feelings of reduced self-efficacy and low personal control. To ease tension, strategies are used that can result in nurses refusing to endorse their knowledge, which can increase patients' pain. Relevance to clinical practice: Clinical supervision will serve to increase the nurses' self-awareness; however, without power and autonomy to make decisions and affect change, feelings of helplessness, reduced self-efficacy and cognitive dissonance can increase. This may explain why, despite educational efforts to increase knowledge, a concomitant change in practice has not occurred.

9,1423,9,"Criminal and juvenile court cases are often resolved through plea bargaining. Although the courts have decreed that plea decisions must be made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily, little is known about legal professionals’ broader perceptions of defendants’ engagement in the plea process; in other words, professionals’ views of whether defendants understand, attend to, and participate in the plea process. Perceptions of juvenile defendants are of particular interest, given that they are especially vulnerable to poor understanding and often participate minimally in their legal cases. The current research surveyed legal professionals about their perceptions of juvenile defendants’ engagement in the plea process and examined whether perceptions differed by legal roles (prosecutor, defense attorney, or judge). We defined engagement as juveniles’ legal understanding of and participation in the plea process. Overall, professionals viewed juvenile defendants as moderately engaged, although defense attorneys viewed juveniles as significantly less engaged than did judges and prosecutors. Given that research suggests juveniles are indeed less engaged than are their adult counterparts, improved methods of enhancing engagement in the plea process are needed.

9,1424,4,"Many socially important search tasks are characterized by low target prevalence, meaning that targets are rarely encountered. For example, transportation security officers (TSOs) at airport checkpoints encounter very few actual threats in carry-on bags. In laboratory-based visual search experiments, low prevalence reduces the probability of detecting targets (Wolfe, Horowitz, & Kenner, 2005). In the lab, this ""prevalence effect"" is caused by changes in decision and response criteria (Wolfe & Van Wert, 2010) and can be mitigated by presenting a burst of high-prevalence search with feedback (Wolfe et al., 2007). The goal of this study was to see if these effects could be replicated in the field with TSOs. A total of 125 newly trained TSOs participated in one of two experiments as part of their final evaluation following training. They searched for threats in simulated bags across five blocks. The first three blocks were low prevalence (target prevalence <= .05) with no feedback; the fourth block was high prevalence (.50) with full feedback; and the final block was, again, low prevalence. We found that newly trained TSOs were better at detecting targets at high compared to low prevalence, replicating the prevalence effect. Furthermore, performance was better (and response criterion was more ""liberal"") in the low-prevalence block that took place after the high-prevalence block than in the initial three low-prevalence blocks, suggesting that a burst of high-prevalence trials may help alleviate the prevalence effect in the field.",Wolfe,2013,"Prevalence effects in newly trained airport checkpoint screeners: Trained observers miss rare targets, too",JOURNAL OF VISION,13,,,Web of Science,"Wolfe, Jeremy M.; Brunelli, David N.; Rubinstein, Joshua; Horowitz, Todd S."

9,1427,4,"Background: Bipolar disorders (BD) are often misdiagnosed. Clinicians seem to use heuristics instead of following the recommendations of diagnostic manuals. Bruchmüller and Meyer (2009) suggest that ‘reduced sleep’ is a prototypic criterion that increases the likelihood of a bipolar diagnosis. This study examines if this criterion specifically elevates the likelihood of a bipolar diagnosis or if the finding of the study mentioned above is rather due to the total number of criteria. Furthermore, we want to replicate the finding that patients offering a causal explanation for their manic symptoms are misdiagnosed more often. Additionally, we examine therapeutic attributes that might influence diagnostic decisions as well as treatment consequences following a (mis-)diagnosis. Methods: 204 Psychotherapists were presented with a case vignette describing someone with a BD and were asked to make a diagnosis. Symptoms and the total number of criteria varied systematically within the vignettes but each still fulfilled enough diagnostic criteria to be diagnosed as bipolar. Results: Almost 60% of the clinicians made misdiagnoses. A correct diagnosis did not depend on the specific criterion of ‘reduced sleep’ but on the total number of criteria. The causal explanation as well as therapeutic attributes did not significantly influence diagnostic decisions. However, the study showed that a misdiagnosis can lead to severe consequences concerning the treatment recommended by clinicians. Limitations: The validity of case vignettes is discussible. Conclusions: It seems as if specific symptoms might not be of so much relevance as assumed. Instead, clinicians seem to follow the additive model when making diagnoses.

9,1428,9,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the detrimental effects of the door-in-the-face (DITF) tactic in repeated negotiation. A more complete understanding of its negative consequences is essential to make an informed decision about its use.Design/methodology/approach This paper is the product of two between-subjects scenario-based negotiation experiments involving university students in Hong Kong (Study 1) and professionals in the UK with negotiation experience (Study 2).Findings Both the studies herein showed that detecting opponents using this tactic reduced the degree to which negotiators found their counterparts trustworthy. It also increased the likelihood of negotiators switching to an alternative partner in a collaborative project. This relationship is mediated by perceived trustworthiness. Negotiators who had detected opponents' use of DITF made higher offers and obtained better outcomes in a subsequent negotiation. These findings indicate that negotiators who benefitted from DITF considered its use ethical, while those who suffered because of its use by others found it unethical.Practical implications Before using DITF, users should be wary of the likelihood they and their counterpart will negotiate again and/or will collaborate in a future project.Originality/value This paper presents a new perspective from which the use of DITF may backfire in a subsequent negotiation, in terms of both objective and subjective outcomes.

Agency issues are a continuing area of concern providing accountants with an ability to shirk their responsibilities and hide confidential information, which may affect their career prospects if disclosed. This ongoing study explores these notions within a stakeholder context and uses a post test only field experiment to gain evidence to support the existence of an agency problem and that membership to one of a number of motivational typologies directly affects the way accountants respond to ethical issues.

Radiographers are ideally suited to this role having the responsibility for conducting the actual X-ray examination.Method: The image interpretation performance of one cohort of student radiographers was measured upon enrolment from UCAS in the first week of university education and then again prior to graduation using RadBench (n = 23).Results: The results identified that novices have a range of natural image interpretation skills; accuracy 35e85%, sensitivity 45e100%, specificity 15e85%, mean ROC 0.691. Graduates presented a narrower range; accuracy 60e90%, sensitivity 40e100%, specificity 60e90%, mean ROC 0.841. The positive shift in graduate mean accuracy (+16%) was driven by increases in specificity (+27%) rather than sensitivity (+5%). No statistically significant differences (ANOVA) could be found between age group, gender and previous education however trends were identified. 56.5% of the population (n = 13) met a benchmark accurate standard of 80%, including one graduate who met 90%.Conclusion: Image interpretation testing at the point of UCAS entry is a useful indicator of future performance and is a recommended factor for consideration as part of the selection process.

,1437,2,"Aim: This paper is a report of a study of the relationship between nurses’ clinical experience and calibration of their self-confidence and judgement accuracy for critical event risk assessment judgements. Background: Miscalibration (i.e. under-confidence or over-confidence of confidence levels) has an important impact on the quality of nursing care. Despite this, little is known about how nurses’ subjective confidence is calibrated with the accuracy of their judgments. Methods: A sample of 103 nursing students and 34 experienced nurses were exposed to 25 risk assessment vignettes. For each vignette they made dichotomous judgements of whether the patient in each scenario was at risk of a critical event, and assigned confidence ratings (0–100) to their judgement calls. The clinical vignettes and judgement criteria were generated from real patient cases. The methodology of confidence calibration was used to calculate calibration measures and generate calibration curves. Data were collected between March 2007 and January 2008. Findings: Experienced nurses were statistically significantly more confident than students but no more accurate. Whilst students tended towards under-confidence, experienced nurses were over-confident. Experienced nurses were no more calibrated than students. Experienced nurses were no better at discriminating between correct and incorrect judgements than students. These patterns were exacerbated when nurses and students were extremely over-confident or extremely under-confident. Conclusion: Nurses were systematically biased towards over/under-confidence in their critical event risk assessment judgements. In particular, experienced nurses were no better calibrated than their student counterparts; with student under-confidence countered by experienced nurses’ greater susceptibility to over-confidence.

Confidence calibration statistics were calculated and calibration curves generated.Results: Nurse students were underconfident (mean over/underconfidence score -1.05) and experienced nurses overconfident (mean over/underconfidence score 6.56), P = 0.01. No significant differences in calibration and resolution were found between the two groups (P = 0.80 and P = 0.51, respectively). There was a significant interaction between time pressure and task difficulty on confidence (P = 0.008); time pressure increased confidence in easy cases but reduced confidence in difficult cases. Time pressure had no effect on confidence or accuracy. Judgment task difficulty impacted significantly on nurses' judgmental accuracy and confidence. A 'hard-easy' effect was observed: nurses were overconfident in difficult judgments and underconfident in easy judgments.Conclusion: Nurses were poorly calibrated when making risk assessment judgments in a high fidelity simulated setting. Nurses with more experience tended toward overconfidence. Whilst time pressure had little effect on calibration, nurses' over/underconfidence varied significantly with the degree of task difficulty. More research is required to identify strategies to minimize such cognitive biases.",Yang,2012,"The effect of clinical experience, judgment task difficulty and time pressure on nurses' confidence calibration in a high fidelity clinical simulation",BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING,12,,,Web of Science,"Yang, Huiqin; Thompson, Carl; Bland, Martin"
9,1439,4,"Context: A recent study has suggested that assessors judge performance comparatively rather than against fixed standards. Ratings assigned to borderline trainees were found to be biased by previously seen candidates’ performances. We extended that programme of investigation by examining these effects across a range of performance levels. Furthermore, we investigated whether confidence in the rating assigned predicts susceptibility to manipulation and whether prompting consideration of typical performance lessens the influence of recent experience. Methods: Consultant doctors were randomised to groups within an internet experiment. The descending performance group judged videos of Foundation Year 1 (F1; postgraduate Year 1) doctors in descending order of proficiency; the ascending performance group judged the same videos in ascending order. For all videos, participants rated: (i) trainee competence; (ii) rater confidence and (iii) percentage better (the percentage of other F1 doctors who would perform better on the same task). Results: Overall, the descending performance group assigned lower scores than the ascending performance group (2.97 [95% confidence interval 2.73–3.20] versus 3.50 [95% confidence interval 3.25–3.74]; F(1,47) = 9.80, p = 0.003, d = 0.52). Pairwise comparisons showed differences were significant for good and borderline performances. The percentage better ratings showed a similar pattern (descending performance mean = 57.4 [95% confidence interval 52.5–62.3], ascending performance mean = 43.4 [95% confidence interval 38.4–48.5]; F (1, 46) = 16.0, p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.67). Confidence ratings did not vary by level of performance and showed no relationship with the effect of group. Discussion: Assessors’ judgements showed contrast effects at both good and borderline performance levels. Findings suggest that assessors use normative rather than criterion‐referenced decision making while judging, and that the norms referenced are weakly represented in memory and easily influenced. Confidence ratings suggested a lack of insight into this phenomenon. Raters’ judgements could be importantly influenced in ways that are unfair to candidates.

9,1440,9,"The authors examined the impacts of selection, optimization, and compensation (SOC) strategies—elective selection, loss-based selection, optimization, and compensation—on job performance across adulthood. A cross-sectional survey (Study 1, N = 355) and a 5-day experience sampling study (Study 2, N = 87) were conducted to assess Chinese insurance sales workers’ global and momentary employment of SOC strategies at work and compare the effectiveness of these strategies in predicting their job performance. Study 1 revealed that the use of compensation predicted higher performance maintenance among older workers, whereas the use of elective selection contributed positively to sales productivity for both age groups, with stronger association for younger workers. Study 2 demonstrated that the positive impact of SOC strategies on global and momentary measures of job performance differed across tasks with various difficulty levels. When the task was perceived as highly difficult, older workers’ greater use of elective selection predicted higher self-rated task performance; however, the positive association was weaker among younger workers. Older workers’ greater use of the 4 SOC strategies was positively associated with sales increases when the task was not difficult or moderately difficult, yet the relationship was negative when the task was highly difficult. A reverse pattern was observed among younger workers. This article contributes to the understanding of working adults’ psychological adaptation to the process of aging and reveals the moderating role of task difficulty on the association between SOC strategies and performance outcomes.

9,1441,9,"Background: The validity of high-stakes decisions derived from assessment results is of primary concern to candidates and certifying institutions in the health professions. In the field of orthopaedic manual physical therapy (OMPT), there is a dearth of documented validity evidence to support the certification process particularly for short-answer tests. To address this need, we examined the internal structure of the Case History Assessment Tool (CHAT); this is a new assessment rubric developed to appraise written responses to a short-answer test of clinical reasoning in post-graduate OMPT certification in Canada.Methods: Fourteen physical therapy students (novices) and 16 physical therapists (PT) with minimal and substantial OMPT training respectively completed a mock examination. Four pairs of examiners (n = 8) participated in appraising written responses using the CHAT. We conducted separate generalizability studies (G studies) for all participants and also by level of OMPT training. Internal consistency was calculated for test questions with more than 2 assessment items. Decision studies were also conducted to determine optimal application of the CHAT for OMPT certification.Results: The overall reliability of CHAT scores was found to be moderate; however, reliability estimates for the novice group suggest that the scale was incapable of accommodating for scores of novices. Internal consistency estimates indicate item redundancies for several test questions which will require further investigation.Conclusion: Future validity studies should consider discriminating the clinical reasoning competence of OMPT trainees strictly at the post-graduate level. Although rater variance was low, the large variance attributed to error sources not incorporated in our G studies warrant further investigations into other threats to validity. Future examination of examiner stringency is also warranted.",Yeung,2016,Validity of a new assessment rubric for a short-answer test of clinical reasoning,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,16,,,Web of Science,"Yeung, Euson; Kulasagarem, Kulamakan; Woods, Nicole; Dubrowski, Adam; Hodges, Brian; Carnahan, Heather"

9,1443,4,"In this study of willingness to learn from experience, it was hypothesized that managers would show a negative outcome bias, that is, a stronger tendency to initiate ""learning-from-experience"" processes after negative outcomes than after positive outcomes. Another aim of the study was to explore the impact of the existence of early warning signals about decision outcomes on the magnitude of the negative outcome bias. Eighty-three managers were asked to read vignettes describing a managerial decision and its outcomes. The outcomes were either positive or negative, and in half of the cases early warning signals existed that made it possible to predict potential negative outcomes while in the other half there were no such signals. The managers were asked to evaluate the need for a learning-from-experience process in general and to rate the degree to which several specific learning processes should be instituted in each of the scenarios. As hypothesized, a negative-outcome bias was found. The more negative the outcomes described, the stronger the managers' inclination to recommend a more intensive learning process. Similarly, a need to ensure control and follow-up procedures was reported mostly after negative outcomes. The existence of early warning signals before the decision was...

9,1445,4,"Background: The presence of newly graduated nurses (NGNs) in clinical settings increases the rates of clinical errors and patient injury. In addition, the turnover rate for NGN staffs is significantly higher than the average turnover rate. Therefore, familiarizing NGNs with their workplace and increasing their professional self-confidence increase their empowerment and efficiency.Purpose: This article elicits the strategies used by NGNs to gain self-confidence during their early career.Methods: This qualitative study was conducted using the purposive sampling method and was based on the data saturation principle. Data were collected using in-depth, semi-structured interviews from 30 NGNs working at teaching hospitals in four northwest provinces of Iran during 2012 and 2013. Data were collected by means of in-depth semistructured interviews. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data.Results: The interviews elicited eight coping strategies that participants used to form self-confidence during the first 6 months of their career. These strategies included familiarity, knowledge enhancement, clinical skills learning, self-exploration, validation, responsibility, mutual interaction, and personal creativity. In addition, participants used these strategies to reinforce their self-confidence during their first 2 years at work.Conclusions/Implications for Practice: The results of this research increase the understanding of NGNs, managers, and healthcare professionals regarding the strategies used by NGNs to gain self-confidence. This knowledge may be applied in programs designed to increase the empowerment and efficacy of nurses to improve the quality of patient care and reduce nurse turnover.",Zamanzadeh,2014,Experiences of Newly Graduated Nurses on Strategies of Gaining Self-Confidence During Their Initial Work: A Qualitative Study,JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH,22,283,291,Web of Science,"Zamanzadeh, Vahid; Roshangar, Fariborz; Fathi-Azar, Eskandar; Valizadeh, Leila; Kirkwood, Jodyanne"
9,1446,4,"Background: Society anticipates that plastic surgeons will make ethical decisions that are solely in the best interest of their patients. However, a variety of competing factors exert an influence on all decision-making processes.Methods: Multiple competing factors that commonly influence decision-making by plastic surgeons, on both conscious and subconscious levels, are identified. By exploring the ramifications of these factors, a more ethical outcome can be achieved.Results: Some of these competing interests that can sidetrack ethical decision-making include personal finances (e.g., ownership of surgical centers, selection of procedures, pricing); outside regulations (e.g., Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 and care of the uninsured); and professional duty (e.g., informed consent, discussion of error).Conclusions: Plastic surgeons who are aware of the competing interests that influence their decision-making processes stand a greater chance of achieving ethical outcomes. Nevertheless, with the growing volume of nonreimbursed care and expectations of perfect outcomes, achieving uniformly ethical decisions without burdensome self-sacrifice is difficult at best.",Zbar,2008,Ethical issues for the plastic surgeon in a tumultuous health care system: Dissecting the anatomy of a decision,PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY,122,1245,1252,Web of Science,"Zbar, Ross I.

,1447,2,"Although legal contexts are subject to biased reasoning and decision making, to identify and test debiasing techniques has largely remained an open task. We report on experimentally deploying the technique “giving reasons pro et contra ” with professional ( N = 239) and lay judges ( N = 372) at Swedish municipal courts. Using a mock legal scenario, participants assessed the relevance of an eyewitness’s previous conviction for his credibility. On average, both groups displayed low degrees of bias. We observed a small positive debiasing effect only for professional judges. Strong evidence was obtained for a relation between profession and relevance-assessment: Lay judges seemed to assign a greater importance to the prior conviction than professional judges did. We discuss challenges for future research, calling other research groups to contribute additional samples.

9,1448,9,"Background: Euthanasia and physician assisted suicide (PAS) are highly debated upon particularly in the light of medical advancement and an aging society. Little is known about the professionals' willingness to perform these practices particularly among those engaged in the field of palliative care and pain management. Thus a study was performed among those professionals.Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was handed out to all participants of a palliative care congress and a pain symposium in 2013. The questionnaire consisted of 8 questions regarding end of life decisions. Proposed patient vignettes were used. Results: A total of 470 eligible questionnaires were returned, 198 by physicians, 272 by nurses. The response rate was 64 %. The majority of professionals were reluctant to perform euthanasia or PAS: 5.3 % of the respondents would be willing to perform euthanasia on a patient with a terminal illness if asked to do so. The reluctance grew in case of a patient with a non-terminal illness. The respondents were more willing to perform PAS than euthanasia. Nurses were more reluctant to take action as opposed to the physicians. The majority of the respondents would attempt to treat the patient's symptoms first before considering life-ending measures. As regards any decision making process the majority would consult with a colleague.Conclusions: This is the first German study to ask about the willingness of professionals to take action as regards euthanasia and PAS without biased phrasing. As opposed to the general acceptance that is respectively high, the actual willingness to perform life-ending measures is low. The German debate on physician assisted suicide and its possible legalization should also incorporate clarifications regarding the responsibility who should eventually perform these acts.",Zenz,2015,Palliative care professionals' willingness to perform euthanasia or physician assisted suicide,BMC PALLIATIVE CARE,14,,,Web of Science,"Zenz, Julia; Tryba, Michael; Zenz, Michael"
9,1449,4,"Objective: To test the network disentangling model for explaining air traffic controllers' (ATCos) conflict resolution performance. The network rigidity index (NRI), and the steps to break the relational complexity network following a central-available-node-first rule, was hypothesized to explain the overall task demand, whereas marginal-effort-decrease rule was expected to explain the actual operational outcome. Background: Understanding the conflict resolution process of ATCos is important for aviation safety and efficiency. However, linear models are insufficient. We proposed a new model that ATCos behavior can be largely considered as a process to break the relational complexity network, in which nodes represent the aircraft while links represent the cognitive complexity to understand the aircraft dyad relationship. Method: Twenty-one professional ATCos completed 27 conflict resolution scenarios that varied in the NRI and other control variables. Multilevel regression analyses were performed to understand the influence of the NRI on the number of interventions, mental workload, and unresolved rate. A cross-validation was performed to evaluate the predictive power of the model. Results: NRI influenced ATCos intervention number in a curvilinear manner, which further leads to ATCo's mental workload. The deviance between the number of interventions and the NRI was strongly linked with unresolved rate. Cross-validation suggests that the models predictions are robust. Conclusion: The network disentangling model provides a useful theory-driven way to explain controllers' conflict resolution workload and other important performance outcomes such as intervention probability. Application: The proposed model can potentially be used for workload management, sector design, and intelligent decision support tool development.",Zhang,2019,The Difficulty to Break a Relational Complexity Network Can Predict Air Traffic Controllers' Mental Workload and Performance in Conflict Resolution,HUMAN FACTORS,,,,Web of Science,"Zhang, Jingyu; E, Xiaotian; Du, Feng; Yang, Jiazhong; Loft, Shayne"
