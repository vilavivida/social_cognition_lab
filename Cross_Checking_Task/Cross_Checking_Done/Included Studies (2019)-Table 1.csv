Ninety-three trainees were studied over the course of 15 hr (across 2 weeks) of skill acquisition practice on a complex, air traffic controller simulation task (Terminal Radar Approach Controller; TRACON; Wesson International, Austin, TX). Across task practice, measures of self-efficacy, and negative and positive motivational thought occurrence were collected to examine prediction of later performance and communality with pretask measures, Results demonstrate independent and interactive influences of ability tests and self-report measures in predicting training task performance. Implications for the selection process are discussed in terms of communalities observed in the predictor space.

,4,X,Expert vs novice players,Response accuracy,Alder,2014,The coupling between gaze behavior and opponent kinematics during anticipation of badminton shots,"Purpose: We examined links between the kinematics of an opponent’s actions and the visual search behaviors of badminton players responding to those actions. Method: A kinematic analysis of international standard badminton players ( n = 4) was undertaken as they completed a range of serves. Video of these players serving was used to create a life-size temporal occlusion test to measure anticipation responses. Expert ( n = 8) and novice ( n = 8) badminton players anticipated serve location while wearing an eye movement registration system. Results: During the execution phase of the opponent’s movement, the kinematic analysis showed between-shot differences in distance traveled and peak acceleration at the shoulder, elbow, wrist and racket. Experts were more accurate at responding to the serves compared to novice players. Expert players fixated on the kinematic locations that were most discriminating between serve types more frequently and for a longer duration compared to novice players. Moreover, players were generally more accurate at responding to serves when they fixated vision upon the discriminating arm and racket kinematics. Conclusions: Findings extend previous literature by providing empirical evidence that expert athletes’ visual search behaviors and anticipatory responses are inextricably linked to the opponent action being observed.

Evidence suggests that accurate diagnosis of skin lesions is achieved predominately through non-analytical pattern recognition (via training examples) and not by rule-based algorithms. If the ABCD are to function as a useful public education tool they must be used reliably by untrained novices, with low inter-observer and intra-diagnosis variation, but with maximal inter-diagnosis differences. The three subjective properties (the ABCs of the ABCD) were investigated experimentally: 33 laypersons scored 40 randomly selected lesions (10 lesions x 4 diagnoses: benign naevi, dysplastic naevi, melanomas, seborrhoeic keratoses) for the three properties on visual analogue scales. The results (n=3,960) suggest that novices cannot use the ABCs reliably to discern benign from malignant lesions.",ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA,91,125,130,Web of Science,"Aldridge, R.

,6,X,public vs police officers,Guilty judgments,Alison,2012,When do we Believe Experts? The Power of the Unorthodox View,"This paper examines the extent to which orthodoxy (degree of typicality) and congruence (degree of similarity with own opinion) mediate the influence of expert advice on decision makers' judgments. Overall, 227 members of the public and 60 police officers completed an online questionnaire involving an investigation into a child sex offence. Participants were asked to first (i) formulate their own ""profile"" of a likely offender then (ii) estimate the guilt of two presented suspect descriptions (orthodox vs. unorthodox), and, following the presentation of an ""expert's"" profile that matched either the orthodox or the unorthodox suspect, (iii) re-evaluate their guilt judgments of the two suspects based on this new advice. Finally, (iv) the perceived similarity (congruence) between the participants' own and the expert profile was assessed. Results revealed two key findings. First, expert profiles that matched a suspect's description elevated perceptions of guilt in that suspect, whilst also, simultaneously, very significantly decreasing the perception of guilt of the alternative suspect. This suggests a powerful rejection and downward revision of the other suspect. Second, perceived similarity of the profile (to one's own profile) was only a significant factor in increasing guilt judgments when assigning guilt to the unorthodox (as opposed to orthodox) suspect. Comparisons of lay judgments with those of police officers revealed few significant differences in effects. The finding that advice is most influential when unorthodox and incongruent suggests that decision makers are more likely to reevaluate judgments when expert advice contributes novel information that contradicts their beliefs. The practical implications of these findings are discussed for profilers, police, and decision research in general.",BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES & THE LAW,30,729,748,Web of Science,"Alison, Laurence; Almond, Louise; Christiansen, Paul; Waring, Sara; Power, Nicola; Villejoubert, Gaelle",
,7,X,varying expertise,decision time and errors,Andrews,2008,Decision times and errors increase when classifying trunk postures near posture bin boundaries,"The purpose of this study was to quantify decision time and classification errors made during trunk posture assessment tasks using a computerised sampling approach. Ninety (45 male, 45 female) university-aged participants, who had varying expertise with body posture evaluation, were asked to accurately classify a series of static images of the trunk using a computer interface by selecting the posture category or 'bin', within which the presented posture fell. Images were presented randomly in either a flexion/extension or lateral bending view at various distances from the boundary lines of each posture bin. Subjects with the least experience performed the tasks in the shortest amount of time; however, they also made the most errors. Expert participants reduced the number of classification errors by increasing the time of each posture classification decision. The flexion/extension task proved to take more time and resulted in more errors than the lateral bend task. The closer the presented images were to the bin boundaries, the greater was the time taken and errors made during posture classification. These data have implications for the design of posture classification biomechanical software interfaces and the training of operators who utilise the software.

9,9,X,children,social categorization,Apfelbaum,2008,Learning (not) to talk about race: When older children underperform in social categorization,"The present research identifies an anomaly in sociocognitive development, whereby younger children (8 and 9 years) outperform their older counterparts (10 and 11 years) in a basic categorization task in which the acknowledgment of racial difference facilitates performance. Though older children exhibit superior performance on a race-neutral version of the task, their tendency to avoid acknowledging race hinders objective success when race is a relevant category. That these findings emerge in late childhood, in a pattern counter to the normal developmental trajectory of increased cognitive expertise in categorization, suggests that this anomaly indicates the onset of a critical transition in human social development.

In evaluating Ss' responses, judgments that departed from a theoretical model were considered errors, while judgments not conforming with known external criteria were considered mistakes. Results confirm the expectation that Ss' multiple hypotheses judgments would be characterized by errors but not mistakes. The absence of mistakes reflects substantive expertise, while the presence of errors reflects a lack of normative expertise. A 2nd study compared the earlier results to those of 47 accounting students (inexperienced Ss) to establish whether the strong substantive performance of the professional auditors was attributed to their expertise or was an artifact of the task. Results support the substantive expertise explanation.

,11,X,varying levels of experienced dentists,Accuracy,Avon,2010,Error rates in bite mark analysis in an in vivo animal model,"Recent judicial decisions have specified that one foundation of reliability of comparative forensic disciplines is description of both scientific approach used and calculation of error rates in determining the reliability of an expert opinion. Thirty volunteers were recruited for the analysis of dermal bite marks made using a previously established in vivo porcine-skin model. Ten participants were recruited from three separate groups: dentists with no experience in forensics, dentists with an interest in forensic odontology, and board-certified diplomates of the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO). Examiner demographics and measures of experience in bite mark analysis were collected for each volunteer. Each participant received 18 completely documented, simulated in vivo porcine bite mark cases and three paired sets of human dental models. The paired maxillary and mandibular models were identified as suspect A, suspect B, and suspect C. Examiners were tasked to determine, using an analytic method of their own choosing, whether each bite mark of the 18 bite mark cases provided was attributable to any of the suspect dentitions provided. Their findings were recorded on a standardized recording form. The results of the study demonstrated that the group of inexperienced examiners often performed as well as the board-certified group, and both inexperienced and board-certified groups performed better than those with an interest in forensic odontology that had not yet received board certification. Incorrect suspect attributions (possible false inculpation) were most common among this intermediate group. Error rates were calculated for each of the three observer groups for each of the three suspect dentitions. This study demonstrates that error rates can be calculated using an animal model for human dermal bite marks, and although clinical experience is useful, other factors may be responsible for accuracy in bite mark analysis. Further, this study demonstrates that even under carefully controlled conditions, albeit in a forced-decision model, errors in interpretation occur even amongst the most experienced analysts.

,12,X,third vs fourth year nursing students,nursing diagnostic accuracy,Baena,2013,Application of a model based on fuzzy logic for evaluating nursing diagnostic accuracy of students,"Purpose: To describe a model for assessing nursing diagnostic accuracy and its application to undergraduate students, comparing students' performance according to the course year. 

Methods: This model, based on the theory of fuzzy sets, guides a student through three steps: (a) the student must parameterize the model by establishing relationship values between defining characteristic/risk factors and nursing diagnoses; (b) presentation of a clinical case; (c) the student must define the presence of each defining characteristic/risk factors for the clinical case. Subsequently, the model computes the most plausible diagnoses by taking into account the values indicated by the student. This gives the student a performance score in comparison with parameters and diagnoses that were previously provided by nursing experts. These nursing experts collaborated with the construction of the model indicating the strength of the relationship between the concepts, meaning, they parameterized the model to compare the student's choice with the expert's choice (gold standard), thus generating performance scores for the student. The model was tested using three clinical cases presented to 38 students in their third and fourth years of the undergraduate nursing course. 

Results: Third year students showed superior performance in identifying the presence of defining characteristic/risk factors, while fourth year students showed superior performance in the diagnoses by the model. 

Conclusions: The Model for Evaluation of Diagnostic Accuracy Based on Fuzzy Logic applied in this study is feasible and can be used to evaluate students' performance. In this regard, it will open a broad variety of applications for learning and nursing research. 

Limitations: Despite the ease in filling the printed questionnaires out, the number of steps and fields to fill in may explain the considerable number of questionnaires with incorrect or missing data. This was solved in the digital version of the questionnaire. In addition, in more complex cases, it is possible that an expert opinion can lead to a wrong decision due to the subjectivity of the diagnostic process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, many disputes do not settle: the presence of cognitive biases, such as those observed through framing manipulations, is thought to be one of the many reasons for settlement failure. The present study used quantitative and qualitative data to compare the impact of a gain- or loss-framed hypothetical civil litigation scenario on settlement decisions made by lawyers and other nonlawyer professionals. A significant effect of framing was found for both groups. As predicted, both nonlawyers and lawyers were much more likely to settle their claim in the gain scenario than in the loss scenario. This finding was supported by the qualitative data: risk-averse comments were more frequent in the gain frame whereas risk-seeking statements were more common in the loss frame. There was also evidence that lawyers may be less affected by framing than nonlawyers, although a smaller difference was observed than in previous studies. In addition, lawyers were more likely than nonlawyers to consider the expected financial value of the litigation in making their decision. We discuss the implications of these results and suggest avenues for future research.",JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL LEGAL STUDIES,11,578,600,Web of Science,"Belton, Ian K.; Thomson, Mary; Dhami, Mandeep K.",

Whether scientists can accurately assess which experiments will reproduce original findings is important to determining the pace at which science self-corrects. We collected forecasts from basic and preclinical cancer researchers on the first 6 replication studies conducted by the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (RP: CB) to assess the accuracy of expert judgments on specific replication outcomes. On average, researchers forecasted a 75% probability of replicating the statistical significance and a 50% probability of replicating the effect size, yet none of these studies successfully replicated on either criterion (for the 5 studies with results reported). Accuracy was related to expertise: experts with higher h-indices were more accurate, whereas experts with more topic-specific expertise were less accurate. Our findings suggest that experts, especially those with specialized knowledge, were overconfident about the RP: CB replicating individual experiments within published reports; researcher optimism likely reflects a combination of overestimating the validity of original studies and underestimating the difficulties of repeating their methodologies.",PLOS BIOLOGY,15,,,Web of Science,"Benjamin, Daniel; Mandel, David R.; Kimmelman, Jonathan",

,18,X,novices and chess experts,decision / the neural mechanisms,Bilalić,2010,Mechanisms and neural basis of object and pattern recognition: A study with chess experts,"Comparing experts with novices offers unique insights into the functioning of cognition, based on the maximization of individual differences. Here we used this expertise approach to disentangle the mechanisms and neural basis behind two processes that contribute to everyday expertise: object and pattern recognition. We compared chess experts and novices performing chess-related and -unrelated (visual) search tasks. As expected, the superiority of experts was limited to the chess-specific task, as there were no differences in a control task that used the same chess stimuli but did not require chess-specific recognition. The analysis of eye movements showed that experts immediately and exclusively focused on the relevant aspects in the chess task, whereas novices also examined irrelevant aspects. With random chess positions, when pattern knowledge could not be used to guide perception, experts nevertheless maintained an advantage. Experts' superior domain-specific parafoveal vision, a consequence of their knowledge about individual domain-specific symbols, enabled improved object recognition. Functional magnetic resonance imaging corroborated this differentiation between object and pattern recognition and showed that chess-specific object recognition was accompanied by bilateral activation of the occipitotemporal junction, whereas chess-specific pattern recognition was related to bilateral activations in the middle part of the collateral sulci. Using the expertise approach together with carefully chosen controls and multiple dependent measures, we identified object and pattern recognition as two essential cognitive processes in expert visual cognition, which may also help to explain the mechanisms of everyday perception.

The influence of motor skill on decision making,"Objectives: The influence of motor skill on perceptual-cognitive and perceptual-motor decision making has been theorised but not verified empirically. Method: Expert (n = 19), developmental (n = 20), and lesser-skilled netballers (n = 19) completed tests designed to evaluate three different components of domain-specific expertise: (i) motor skill-execution; (ii) perceptual-cognitive decision making; and (iii) perceptual-motor decision making. Results: Each of the three measures was found to improve commensurate with domain-specific skill. Decisions requiring movements (perceptual-motor) elicited more accurate decision making than simple verbal responses (perceptual-cognitive), irrespective of participant skill. Although motor skill was found to be related to the successful execution of a most appropriate movement in a game situation, it was not found to limit the nature of the decision made by participants. No evidence was found to support the supposition that lesser-skilled participants bias their perceptual-cognitive decisions towards ones supported by their motor ability. Conclusions: Results fail to comprehensively support the contemporary models for the development of perceptual-cognitive and perceptual-motor skill in sport.

The results suggest superior use of orthography in the lexical experts and more reliance on semantic information in nonexperts, and support the importance of facility with orthography–phonology mappings in lexical expertise.

,23,X,"experienced, novice basketball players",final running direction,Camponogara,2017,Expert players accurately detect an opponent’s movement intentions through sound alone,"Sounds offer a rich source of information about events taking place in our physical and social environment. However, outside the domains of speech and music, little is known about whether humans can recognize and act upon the intentions of another agent’s actions detected through auditory information alone. In this study we assessed whether intention can be inferred from the sound an action makes, and in turn, whether this information can be used to prospectively guide movement. In 2 experiments experienced and novice basketball players had to virtually intercept an attacker by listening to audio recordings of that player’s movements. In the first experiment participants had to move a slider, while in the second one their body, to block the perceived passage of the attacker as they would in a real basketball game. Combinations of deceptive and nondeceptive movements were used to see if novice and/or experienced listeners could perceive the attacker’s intentions through sound alone. We showed that basketball players were able to more accurately predict final running direction compared to nonplayers, particularly in the second experiment when the interceptive action was more basketball specific. We suggest that athletes present better action anticipation by being able to pick up and use the relevant kinematic features of deceptive movement from event-related sounds alone. This result suggests that action intention can be perceived through the sound a movement makes and that the ability to determine another person’s action intention from the information conveyed through sound is honed through practice.

In Experiment 1, a video-based offside decision-making task followed by a frame recognition task demonstrated a bias toward flag errors and a forward memory shift for less-successful elite-standard assistant referees that is in line with the predictions from the flash-lag effect. In Experiment 2, an offside decision-making training program demonstrated a substantial progress from pre- to posttest for response accuracy, but not for accuracy of memory in the frame recognition task. In both experiments, no differences were found for visual scan patterns. First, these results suggest that less-successful elite-standard assistant referees are more affected by the flash-lag effect. Second, an off-field perceptual-cognitive training program can help assistant referees to deal with the perceptual consequences of the flash-lag illusion and to readjust their decision-making process accordingly.

Twenty-six club-elite umpires, 33 club-intermediate umpires, and 12 control participants viewed videos which depicted the typical view of an umpire's perspective. Participants were asked to predict the final ball position at the stumps after the video was temporally occluded, using a computer cursor. Videos were occluded at two points, ball bounce and two frames post-bounce. Performance was measured using the horizontal and vertical error in pixels. The club-elite and club-intermediate umpires were more accurate than the control group. All groups made less horizontal error compared to vertical error, particularly in the post-bounce condition. Umpires were more certain of their decisions than control participants. The results indicate that umpires possess a domain-specific skill which enables them to more accurately predict ball path, a critical component of LBW judgements. The results also indicate that vertical judgements were poorer overall.

With a view to advancing ongoing debate in this field, the current study aimed to replicate and extend previous research by exploring the differences in visual-spatial ability between art students (n = 42) and nonart students (n = 37), using a comprehensive battery of visual-spatial and drawing tasks. Art students outperformed nonart students on drawing measures and some (but not all) visual-spatial tasks. This nuanced pattern of results broadly supports the notion that art students differ from nonart students in their ability to exert top-down control over attentional processing, but not in the phenomenology of low-level visual processing. Implications for theories of artistic expertise are discussed.

,27,X,Residents vs interns,Accuracy,Chang,2017,The effect of multimedia replacing text in resident clinical decision-making assessment,"Multimedia in assessing clinical decision-making skills (CDMS) has been poorly studied, particularly in comparison to traditional text-based assessments. The literature suggests multimedia is more difficult for trainees. We hypothesize that pediatric residents score lower in diagnostic skill when clinical vignettes use multimedia rather than text for patient findings. A standardized method was developed to write text-based questions from 60 high-resolution, quality multimedia; a series of expert panels selected 40 questions with both a multimedia and text-based counterpart, and two online tests were developed. Each test featured 40 identical questions with reciprocal and alternating modality (multimedia vs. text). Pediatric residents and rising 4th year medical students (MS-IV) at a single residency were randomized to complete either test stratified by postgraduate training year (PGY). A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA analyzed differences in score due to modality and PGY. Secondary analyses ascertained modality effect in dermatology and respiratory questions using Mann–Whitney U tests, and correlations on test performance to In-service Training Exam (ITE) scores using Spearman rank. Eighty-eight residents and rising interns completed the study. Overall multimedia scores were lower than text-based scores (p = 0.047, η p 2 = 0.04), with highest disparity in rising interns (MS-IV); however, PGY had a greater effect on scores (p = 0.001, η p 2 = 0.16). Respiratory questions were not significantly lower with multimedia (n = 9, median 0.71 vs. 0.86, p = 0.09) nor dermatology questions (n = 13, p = 0.41). ITEs correlated significantly with text-based scores (ρ = 0.23–0.25, p = 0.04–0.06) but not with multimedia scores. In physician trainees with less clinical experience, multimedia-based case vignettes are associated with significantly lower scores. These results help shed light on the role of multimedia versus text-based information in CDMS, particularly in less experienced clinicians.

This appearance-change instruction (ACI) has never been empirically tested. A video crime with four culprits was viewed by 289 participants who then attempted to identify the culprits from four 6-person arrays that either included or did not include the culprit. Participants either received the ACI or not and all were warned that the culprit might or might not be in the arrays. The culprits varied in how much their appearance changed from the video to their lineup arrays, but the ACI did not improve identification decisions for any of the lineups. Collapsed over the four culprits, the ACI increased false alarms and filler identifications but did not increase culprit identifications. The ACI reduced confidence and increased response latency. Two processes that could account for these results are discussed, namely a decision criterion shift and a general increase in ecphoric similarity.

,30,X,Students vs faculty,Performance ratings,Chen,2015,Anchoring effects in simulated academic promotion decisions: How the promotion criterion affects ratings and the decision to support an application,"Six experiments investigated the effect of the promotion criterion in simulated academic promotion decisions. In total, 547 undergraduate students and 33 university faculty members rated a promotion application, and some also indicated their decisions to support or to reject it. Performance ratings were reliably affected by the criterion, with a high criterion resulting in higher ratings than a low criterion, and this criterion effect was found regardless of the evaluator's expertise, whether he or she took the role of an independent assessor or the line manager to the applicant, or whether the criterion was provided by the experimenter or randomly generated by the participant. The criterion also affected the level of support for a candidate when the position applied for was perceived to be extremely competitive, or when a lesser position was considered at a later time. These results provide evidence that the use of a criterion, a fairly common practice in decision‐making processes, may bias performance evaluations, which in turn may have ripple effects that affect the outcome of a chain of events. Our results also shed light on the possible mechanisms that underlie the rating biases in performance appraisal.

9,38,X,Umpires vs expert umpires,"correct, missed, and unwarranted call accuracy ",Corrigan,2019,The influence of match characteristics and experience on decision-making performance in AFL umpires.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of match characteristics and elite level umpiring experience on the decision-making performance of umpires in the Australian Football League (AFL). 
DESIGN: Cross Sectional Study. 
METHODS: All decisions from the 2014 AFL home and away season made by 32 male AFL field umpires (age 33.1Â±5.0years, AFL umpire experience 122Â±105 matches) were classified by a panel of four expert umpire coaches into correct, missed and unwarranted categories. The 8001 decisions were then further categorised based on the match time, score differential, field location, home ground advantage, match attendance and elite level umpiring experience. Chi-square with standardised residuals and two-way analysis of variance were used to analyse the data. 
RESULTS: Higher elite level umpiring experience and a larger score differential at the time of the decision resulted in improved decision-making accuracy. Home ground advantage, attendance and match time did not influence the decision-making performance of umpires. Impact averse decisions occurred in the back line of play, with umpires tending to be conservative with decisions that may impact the score. 
CONCLUSIONS: Decisions that have an increased influence on an umpire's decision-making performance include score differential and elite umpiring experience. Implications on umpiring performance regarding the venue, attendance and the duration of a match were not apparent.",Journal of science and medicine in sport,22,112,116,Web of Science,"Corrigan, Sean L; Dwyer, Dan B; Harvey, Briana; Gastin, Paul B",
,44,X,novice vs. expert sales manager,Bias in forecasting decisions,DeCarlo,2015,How sales manager experience and historical data trends affect decision making,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine how trends in historical data influence two types of predictive judgments: territory selection and salesperson hiring. Sales managers are confronted frequently with decisions that explicitly or implicitly involve forecasting with limited information. In doing so, they conceptualize how the magnitude of these trend effects may be affected by the experience managers have in making these types of judgments. Study 1 provides evidence of a curvilinear relationship between experience and reliance on the trend data whereby the sales territory selections of novice sales managers exhibited greater susceptibility to informational trends than did the evaluations of naïve and expert decision-makers. A benchmark analysis in Study 2 further revealed that the salesperson selections made by novice and expert sales managers were equally biased, albeit in opposite directions, with novices overweighting and experts underweighting historical performance trends. Implications of these findings are discussed, as are avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ an online experimental design methodology of practicing managers. For Study 1, they use regression, whereas Study 2 uses a deterministic process to develop a priori predictive benchmark forecasts. Ordinary least squares is then used to estimate manager’s decisions, which are then compared to the predictive forecasts to determine accuracy. Findings: Study 1 provides evidence of a curvilinear relationship between experience and reliance on the trend data whereby the sales territory selections of novice sales managers exhibited greater susceptibility to informational trends than did the evaluations of naïve and expert decision-makers. A benchmark analysis in Study 2 further revealed that the salesperson selections made by novice and expert sales managers were equally biased, albeit in opposite directions, with novices overweighting and experts underweighting historical performance trends. Originality/value: The present inquiry is the first to provide insights into an important issue that has been the subject of equivocal findings, namely, whether experience in a judgmental domain exerts a facilitating or debilitating effect on sales manager decision-making. In this regard, some research supports the intuition that experience in making a particular type of decision can insulate managers from judgmental bias and, in doing so, improve decision quality (see Shanteau, [1992a] for a summary). In contrast, other work provides a more pessimistic view by demonstrating that the quality of decision-making is either unaffected by or can erode with additional experience (Hutchinson et al ., 2010). To help reconcile these conflicting findings, the authors presented and tested a theoretical framework conceptualizing how trends may influence predictive judgments across three levels of decision-maker experience.

In the study decision making improved with expertise, however, time-to-first fixate a nodule showed only a non-significant trend to decrease with expertise. Surprisingly, naïve and expert observers allocated less visual attention at nodules compared with first and third year radiography students. This similarity in visual attention at nodules but not in decision making was explained by the fact that naïve observers were more likely to fixate and make errors on distracter regions. Time-to-first hit has been linked to expert performance in mammography, but in this study was not sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate clear linear improvements across expertise groups. This brings into question the use of this metric as an indirect measure of rapid initial holistic processing.

,47,X,novice vs experienced clinicians,treatment decisions/plans,Dudley,2015,The utility of case formulation in treatment decision making; the effect of experience and expertise,"Objectives: We examined whether case formulation guides the endorsement of appropriate treatment strategies. We also considered whether experience and training led to more effective treatment decisions. To examine these questions two related studies were conducted both of which used a novel paradigm using clinically relevant decision-making tasks with multiple sources of information. Methods: Study one examined how clinicians utilised a pre-constructed CBT case formulation to plan treatment. Study two utilised a clinician-generated formulation to further examine the process of formulation development and the impact on treatment planning. Both studies considered the effect of therapist experience. Results: Both studies indicated that clinicians used the case formulation to select treatment choices that were highly matched to the case as described in the vignette. However, differences between experts and novice clinicians were only demonstrated when clinicians developed their own formulations of case material. When they developed their own formulations the experts' formulations were more parsimonious, internally consistent, and contained fewer errors and the experts were less swayed by irrelevant treatment options. Limitations: The nature of the experimental task, involving ratings of suitability of possible treatment options suggested for the case, limits the interpretation that formulation directs the development or generation of the clinician's treatment plan. In study two the task may still have limited the capacity to demonstrate further differences between expert and novice therapists. Conclusions: Formulation helps guide certain aspects of effective treatment decision making. When asked to generate a formulation clinicians with greater experience and expertise do this more effectively.

The influence of attractiveness on fraud-risk judgments by internal auditors,"Independence and objectivity are key principles assumed to underlie internal auditors' fraud-risk judgments. However, a substantial body of evidence suggests that physical attractiveness of suspects may influence internal auditors' fraud-risk judgments. In this experimental study we investigated whether internal auditors are susceptible to appearance-related biases, or whether they correct for them due to their expertise and motivation. A total of 193 internal auditors were presented a misappropriation-of-assets scenario in which the attractiveness of a suspect was manipulated. To determine whether professional expertise is associated with increased resilience to appearance-related biases, their fraud-risk judgments were contrasted with those acquired from 240 subjects without auditing experience (naive subjects). In line with our predictions, attractiveness modulated naive subjects' fraud-risk judgments, whereas internal auditors did not show any indication for appearance-related biases. Our findings suggest that internal auditors' experience and motivation may immunize them to the phenomena of physical attractiveness stereotyping and the attractiveness halo effect.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDITING,22,332,344,Web of Science,"Eulerich, Marc; Theis, Jochen C.; Lao, Junpeng; Ramon, Meike",

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate two trainingmodels for the recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis by laypeople, based on expert assessment and eye-tracking technology. A cross-sectional quasi-experimental simulation study was made to evaluate the identification and treatment of anaphylaxis. 50 subjects were randomly assigned to four groups: three groups watching different training videos with content supervised by sanitary personnel and one control group who received face-to-face training during paediatric practice. To evaluate the learning, a simulation scenario represented by an anaphylaxis' victim was designed. A device capturing eye movement as well as expert valuation was used to evaluate the performance. The subjects that underwent paediatric face-to-face training achieved better and faster recognition of the anaphylaxis. They also used the adrenaline injector with better precision and less mistakes, and they needed a smaller number of visual fixations to recognise the anaphylaxis and to make the decision to inject epinephrine. Analysing the different video formats, mixed results were obtained.

,52,X,professional ethics course experience vs not,perception of ethical issues,Fialkov,2014,Effects of experience and surface-level distraction on ability to perceive ethical issues,"In an application of cognitive science research to psychology ethics training, this study investigated the ability of psychology students with 2 levels of experience (professional ethics course; no professional ethics course) to perceive ethical issues in ambiguous scenarios in which psychology ethics issues were not identified to participants as the focus of interest. A triad judgment task, used in studies of cognitive problem representation of learners in other domains (e.g., mathematics and education), had participants choose which of 2 scenarios ""goes best"" with a target scenario. Three types of triads were presented: (a) a scenario with similar surface features (in story narrative) versus unrelated features, (b) scenarios with similar deep structural features (in underlying ethical issue) versus unrelated features, and (c) scenarios with similar surface versus similar structural features. Results showed that when there was competition between surface and structural features, more experienced students were better able to perceive the underlying professional ethical issues. However, all students (with or without psychology ethics training) were able to perceive the professional ethical issues when distracting features were removed. Results are interpreted in reference to a competence–performance distinction found in other domains, which suggests that automatic schema activation for less experienced learners may account for their being distracted by surface features of a problem and not by the inability to perceive important underlying features, that is, psychology ethical issues. Implications are discussed for how these findings about the cognitive processes inherent in ethical decision making in professional counseling and psychology might be used to inform and improve ethics training.

Participants in this study were recruited from a general psychology class to limit preexisting knowledge of psychological disorders. Half of the participants were trained to recognize features of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with the purpose of forming a schema for that disorder, whereas the other half were not. Participants’ memories for diagnostic and nondiagnostic details within a hypothetical case vignette were tested using a free recall prompt followed by a yes–no recognition test. Trained participants falsely recognized the diagnostic detail ""restlessness"" and falsely recalled the diagnostic detail ""uncontrollable worry"" at a significantly higher rate than controls, suggesting that the training successfully formed a schema for GAD symptoms. Graduate training programs should consider incorporating training about false memories in students’ coursework as one mechanism for mitigating these errors.

Rugby league players from one of three different skill levels (high-skilled, intermediate-skilled, and low-skilled), and drawn from three different age levels (senior, under 20, and under 16 years) participated in this study. Video images of various rugby league-specific scenarios, presented from the perspective of a particular player, were projected on to a wall. Players were instructed to react to these plays as they would in a game situation. The test was performed under single-task (i.e., anticipation test in isolation) and dual-task (i.e., the anticipation test while also performing a secondary verbal tone recognition task) conditions. No significant dual-task decrements were observed for primary task performance in any of the playing levels or age groups. However, reductions in performance on the secondary tone recognition task were evident in the form of decreased tone response accuracy and increased verbal response times. Greater response accuracy and faster response times were observed with increases in age and playing level, highlighting the centrality of anticipation to skilled performance in rugby league. The differences in anticipatory skill between playing levels and age groups suggest that the accumulation of a high volume of sport-specific experience may facilitate the development of perceptual expertise in rugby league players.

J Strength Cond Res 22( 6): 2027-2035, 2008-This study investigated the effects of video-based perceptual training on pattern recognition and pattern prediction ability in elite field sport athletes and determined whether enhanced perceptual skills influenced the physiological demands of game-based activities. Sixteen elite women soccer players (mean +/- SD age, 18.3 +/- 2.8 years) were allocated to either a video-based perceptual training group (N = 8) or a control group (N = 8). The video-based perceptual training group watched video footage of international women's soccer matches. Twelve training sessions, each 15 minutes in duration, were conducted during a 4-week period. Players performed assessments of speed (5-, 10-, and 20-m sprint), repeated-sprint ability (6 x 20-m sprints, with active recovery on a 15-second cycle), estimated maximal aerobic power ((V) over doto(2) max, multistage fitness test), and a game-specific video-based perceptual test of pattern recognition and pattern prediction before and after the 4 weeks of video-based perceptual training. The on-field assessments included time-motion analysis completed on all players during a standardized 45-minute small-sided training game, and assessments of passing, shooting, and dribbling decision-making ability. No significant changes were detected in speed, repeated-sprint ability, or estimated (V) over doto(2) max during the training period. However, video-based perceptual training improved decision accuracy and reduced the number of recall errors, indicating improved game awareness and decision-making ability. Importantly, the improvements in pattern recognition and prediction ability transferred to on-field improvements in passing, shooting, and dribbling decision-making skills. No differences were detected between groups for the time spent standing, walking, jogging, striding, and sprinting during the small-sided training game. These findings demonstrate that video-based perceptual training can be used effectively to enhance the decision-making ability of field sport athletes; however, it has no effect on the physiological demands of game-based activities.

Psychological, psychometric, and jurisprudential theory suggest that the answer depends on the form of the relevant legal doctrine: Learning legal rules, which provide explicit direction as to the correct outcome of a case, should reduce the impact of stereotyping; learning legal standards, which require decision-makers to draw inferences from the facts of a case, should not. The results of 2 experimental studies involving undergraduates and law students provide strong support for this theory. In each, consistent with the predictions of the Stereotype Content Model, participants tended to decide cases for the party that was rated by an independent sample to be associated with stereotypically warmer traits unless the participants had learned legal rules and were deciding cases with facts to which those rules applied. Learning legal standards did not moderate this effect. The findings provide additional support for the distinction between rules and standards in law and can inform the public policy decisions between which is most beneficial.

The order in which participants entered the pattern elements in the recall task was also analysed to further examine the nature of the visual–perceptual strategies and the relative emphasis placed upon particular pattern features. The experts demonstrated superior performance across the recall and decision-making tasks [see also Gorman, A. D., Abernethy, B., &amp; Farrow, D. (2012). Classical pattern recall tests and the prospective nature of expert performance. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology , 65, 1151–1160; Gorman, A. D., Abernethy, B., &amp; Farrow, D. (2013a). Is the relationship between pattern recall and decision-making influenced by anticipatory recall? The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 66, 2219–2236)] but a number of significant differences in the visual search data highlighted disparities in the processing strategies, suggesting that recall skill may utilize different underlying visual–perceptual processes than those required for accurate decision-making performance in the natural setting. Performance on the recall task was characterized by a proximal-to-distal order of entry of the pattern elements with participants tending to enter the players located closest to the ball carrier earlier than those located more distal to the ball carrier. The results provide further evidence of the underlying perceptual processes employed by experts when extracting visual information from complex and dynamic patterns.

,70,X,Expert vs novice soccer players,Integrating prior information into decision making,Gredin,2018,Experts integrate explicit contextual priors and environmental information to improve anticipation efficiency,"The understanding of how experts integrate prior situation-specific information (i.e., contextual priors ) with emergent visual information when performing dynamic and temporally constrained tasks is limited. We used a soccer-based anticipation task to examine the ability of expert and novice players to integrate prior information about an opponentâ€™s action tendencies with unfolding environmental information such as opponent kinematics. We recorded gaze behaviors and ongoing expectations during task performance. Moreover, we assessed their final anticipatory judgments and perceived levels of cognitive effort invested. Explicit contextual priors biased the allocation of visual attention and shaped ongoing expectations in experts but not in novices. When the final action was congruent with the most likely action given the opponentâ€™s action tendencies, the contextual priors enhanced the final judgments for both groups. For incongruent trials, the explicit priors had a negative impact on the final judgments of novices but not experts. We interpreted the data using a Bayesian framework to provide novel insights into how contextual priors and dynamic environmental information are combined when making decisions under time pressure. Moreover, we provide evidence that this integration is governed by the temporal relevance of the information at hand as well as the ability to infer this relevance.

,73,X,athletes vs novices,distinguish between movement patterns,Gueldenpenning,2015,Masked priming of complex movements: perceptual and motor processes in unconscious action perception,"Fast motor actions in sports often require the ability to discriminate between similar movement patterns (e.g. feint vs. non-feint) at an early stage. Moreover, an athlete might even initiate a motor response without a conscious processing of the relevant movement information. Therefore, the question was raised of whether or not athletes and novices of a particular movement can unconsciously distinguish between similar movement patterns. Using a masked priming experiment (Experiment 1), it is demonstrated that both groups were similarly able to unconsciously distinguish a feint and a non-feint action. To further investigate whether this result is based on perceptual priming effects or on unconscious motor activations, a second masked priming experiment was conducted (Experiment 2). Experiment 2 revealed perceptual priming effects which are not mediated by motor expertise. Moreover, unconscious pictures of feint and non-feint actions from different movement stages are sufficient to activate a motor response in athletes. In novices, a negative congruency effect occurred. For both groups, largest response congruency effects were found for prime pictures participants could consciously perceive as target pictures during the experimental session. The results found here point out that perceptual priming effects are not mediated by motor expertise whereas response priming effects might be.

In contrast, experts recognize objects within their domain of expertise at the subordinate level (e.g., Sparrow or Finch) for which the internal object information may play an important role in identification (Tanaka &amp; Taylor, 1991). To investigate whether expert recognition relies on internal object information, we band-pass filtered bird images over a range of spatial frequencies (SF) and then masked the filtered image to preserve its global form. In Experiment 1, bird experts categorized common birds at the family level (e.g., Robin or Sparrow) more quickly and more accurately than novices. Both experts and novices were more accurate when bird images contained the internal information represented by a middle range of SFs, and this finding was characterized by a quadratic function in which accuracy decreased toward each end of the SF spectrum. However, the experts, but not the novices, showed a similar quadratic relationship between response times and SF range. In Experiment 2, experts categorized Warblers and Finches at the more specific, species level (e.g., Wilson’s Warbler or House Finch). Recognition was again fastest and most accurate for images filtered in the middle range of SFs. Collectively, these results indicate that a midrange of SFs contain crucial information for subordinate recognition, and that extensive perceptual experience can influence the efficiency with which this information is utilized.

Here, we ask how real-world expertise manifests at basic-level categorization and assess the contribution of stimulus-driven and top-down knowledge-based factors to this manifestation. Car experts and novices categorized computer-selected image fragments of cars, airplanes, and faces. Within each category, the fragments varied in their mutual information (MI), an objective quantifiable measure of feature diagnosticity. Categorization of face and airplane fragments was similar within and between groups, showing better performance with increasing MI levels. Novices categorized car fragments more slowly than face and airplane fragments, while experts categorized car fragments as fast as face and airplane fragments. The experts' advantage with car fragments was similar across MI levels, with similar functions relating RT with MI level for both groups. Accuracy was equal between groups for cars as well as faces and airplanes, but experts' response criteria were biased toward cars. These findings suggest that expertise does not entail only specific perceptual strategies. Rather, at the basic level, expertise manifests as a general processing advantage arguably involving application of top-down mechanisms, such as knowledge and attention, which helps experts to distinguish between object categories.",JOURNAL OF VISION,11,,,Web of Science,"Harel, Assaf; Ullman, Shimon; Harari, Danny; Bentin, Shlomo",
,78,X,Expert vs. novice,Identifying risk ,Harries,2014,Identifying and enhancing risk thresholds in the detection of elder financial abuse: a signal detection analysis of professionals' decision making.,"BACKGROUND: Financial abuse of elders is an under acknowledged problem and professionals' judgements contribute to both the prevalence of abuse and the ability to prevent and intervene. In the absence of a definitive ""gold standard"" for the judgement, it is desirable to try and bring novice professionals' judgemental risk thresholds to the level of competent professionals as quickly and effectively as possible. This study aimed to test if a training intervention was able to bring novices' risk thresholds for financial abuse in line with expert opinion.

METHODS: A signal detection analysis, within a randomised controlled trial of an educational intervention, was undertaken to examine the effect on the ability of novices to efficiently detect financial abuse. Novices (n=154) and experts (n=33) judged ""certainty of risk"" across 43 scenarios; whether a scenario constituted a case of financial abuse or not was a function of expert opinion. Novices (n=154) were randomised to receive either an on-line educational intervention to improve financial abuse detection (n=78) or a control group (no on-line educational intervention, n=76). Both groups examined 28 scenarios of abuse (11 ""signal"" scenarios of risk and 17 ""noise"" scenarios of no risk). After the intervention group had received the on-line training, both groups then examined 15 further scenarios (5 ""signal"" and 10 ""noise"" scenarios).

RESULTS: Experts were more certain than the novices, pre (Mean 70.61 vs. 58.04) and post intervention (Mean 70.84 vs. 63.04); and more consistent. The intervention group (mean 64.64) were more certain of abuse post-intervention than the control group (mean 61.41, p = 0.02). Signal detection analysis of sensitivity (A) and bias (C) revealed that this was due to the intervention shifting the novices' tendency towards saying ""at risk"" (C post intervention -.34) and away from their pre intervention levels of bias (C-.12). Receiver operating curves revealed more efficient judgments in the intervention group.

Ss included 112 medical students, 303 practicing physicians, and 77 specialists in internal medicine, 61 in surgery, 55 in family practice, and 110 in other specialties. Preclinical medical students' mean score was near the chance level. While practicing physicians scored higher, they also demonstrated considerable susceptibility to cognitive bias. Cognitive bias varied by medical speciality with internal medicine physicians scoring best on the ICBM. A controlled educational research study with preclinical medical students showed that learners exposed to a seminar on cognitive bias in medical decision making scored better on the ICBM than their peers.

,82,X,different physician types,diagnosis accuracy,Hertwig,2013,Correlates of diagnostic accuracy in patients with nonspecific complaints,"Objective: To investigate diagnostic accuracy in patient histories involving nonspecific complaints and the extent to which characteristics of physicians and structural properties of patient histories are associated with accuracy. Methods: Six histories of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with nonspecific complaints were provided to 112 physicians: 36 ED physicians, 50 internists, and 26 family practitioners. Physicians listed the 3 most likely diagnoses for each history and indicated which cue(s) they considered crucial. Four weeks later, a subset of 20 physicians diagnosed the same 6 histories again. For each history, experts had previously determined the correct diagnoses and the diagnostic cues. Results: Accuracy ranged from 14% to 64% correct diagnoses (correct diagnosis listed as the most likely) and from 29% to 87% correct differential diagnoses (correct diagnosis listed in the differential). Acute care physicians (ED physicians and internists) included the correct diagnosis in the differential in, on average, 3.4 histories, relative to 2.6 for the family practitioners ( P = 0.001, d = .75). Diagnostic performance was fairly reliable (r = .61, P &lt; 0.001). Clinical experience was negatively correlated with diagnostic accuracy ( r = –.25, P = 0.008). Two structural properties of patient histories—cue consensus and cue substitutability—were significantly associated with diagnostic accuracy, whereas case difficulty was not. Finally, prevalence of diagnosis also proved significantly correlated with accuracy. Conclusions: Average diagnostic accuracy in cases with nonspecific complaints far exceeds chance performance, and accuracy varies with medical specialty. Analyzing cue properties in patient histories can help shed light on determinants of diagnostic performance and thus suggest ways to enhance physicians’ ability to accurately diagnose cases with nonspecific complaints.

In Study 1, experts, intermediate users, and novices predicted the time it would take novices to complete a complex task. In Study 2, expertise was experimentally manipulated. In both studies, those with more expertise were worse predictors of novice performance times and were resistant to debiasing techniques intended to reduce underestimation. Findings from these studies suggest that experts may have a cognitive handicap that leads to underestimating the difficulty novices face and that those with an intermediate level of expertise may be more accurate in predicting novices' performance.

,87,X,Ppn with different expertise,Probability judgments,Ho,1994,THE EFFECT OF INFERENCE ORDER AND EXPERIENCE-RELATED KNOWLEDGE ON DIAGNOSTIC CONJUNCTION PROBABILITIES,"Ideally, a decision maker's diagnostic probability judgments should not be affected by making predictive judgments before making diagnostic inferences. The purpose of this study is to investigate how experience-related knowledge and the inference presentation orderaffect a decision maker's diagnostic conjunction probability judgments. Specifically, when decision makers are asked to make diagnoses in different judgment domains with which they have different levels of experience, we examine how making predictions first affects their subsequent diagnostic judgments in a standard conjunction paradigm. Professional auditors with experience in the auditing domain and MBA students with little or no auditing experience participated in the experiment. The results indicate that when the task involves a domain with which people have experience, making predictions prior to diagnoses has a significant influence on their subsequent diagnosticconjunction probabilities. When auditors made diagnoses in a familiar audit task situation, they were strongly influenced by whether or not they were asked to make predictions in advance. However, there was no influence of inference order on auditors' diagnoses in a medical task, with which they do not have experience-related knowledge. Similarly, MBA students, having no experience-related knowledge in either audit or medical domains, were not affected by the inference order in making diagnoses. In the discussion of these exploratory results, we suggest that this inference order effect may be due to subjects' anchoring on the predictive probability and insufficiently adjusting it to yield the diagnostic probability judgment.

,90,X,novice and expert clinicians ,diagnosis,Hruska,2016,Hemispheric activation differences in novice and expert clinicians during clinical decision making,"Clinical decision making requires knowledge, experience and analytical/non-analytical types of decision processes. As clinicians progress from novice to expert, research indicates decision-making becomes less reliant on foundational biomedical knowledge and more on previous experience. In this study, we investigated how knowledge and experience were reflected in terms of differences in neural areas of activation. Novice and expert clinicians diagnosed simple or complex (easy, hard) cases while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected. Our results highlight key differences in the neural areas activated in novices and experts during the clinical decision-making process. fMRI data were collected from ten second year medical students (novices) and ten practicing gastroenterologists (experts) while they diagnosed sixteen (eight easy and eight hard) clinical cases via multiple-choice questions. Behavioral data were collected for diagnostic accuracy (correct/incorrect diagnosis) and time taken to assign a clinical diagnosis. Two analyses were performed with the fMRI data. First, data from easy and hard cases were compared within respective groups (easy &gt; hard, hard &gt; easy). Second, neural differences between novices and experts (novice &gt; expert, expert &gt; novice) were assessed. Experts correctly diagnosed more cases than novices and made their diagnoses faster than novices on both easy and hard cases (all p ’s &lt; 0.05). Time taken to diagnose hard cases took significantly longer for both novices and experts. While similar neural areas were activated in both novices and experts during the decision making process, we identified significant hemispheric activation differences between novice and expert clinicians when diagnosing hard clinical cases. Specifically, novice clinicians had greater activations in the left anterior temporal cortex and left ventral lateral prefrontal cortex whereas expert clinicians had greater activations in the right dorsal lateral, right ventral lateral, and right parietal cortex. Hemispheric differences in activation were not observed between novices and experts while diagnosing easy clinical cases. While clinical decision-making engaged the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in both novices and experts, interestingly we observed expertise related differences in the regions and hemispheres of PFC activation between these groups for hard clinical cases. Specifically, in novices we observed activations in left hemisphere neural regions associated with factual rule-based knowledge, whereas in experts we observed right hemisphere activation in neural regions associated with experiential knowledge. Importantly, at the neural level, our data highlight differences in so called type 2 clinical decision-making processes related to prior knowledge and experience.

Counseling trainees' ability to read emotions,"This study investigated the ability of counseling trainees and undergraduate students to recognize facially expressed emotions in photographs of Caucasian American and Japanese individuals. Fifty-four counseling trainees and 54 undergraduates viewed these photographs and provided their perceptions of the expressed emotion and a ranking of the intensity of the emotion. Results indicated there were no differences in the accuracy of identifying emotions between undergraduates and counseling trainees, no differences in accuracy based on the participants' gender or gender of the poser, and no differences based on the posers' ethnicity. Overall, little variation was discovered among participants' intensity ratings of the facial expressions. The researchers found that participants perceived Japanese facial expressions as more intense than Caucasian American facial expressions, and female facial expressions as more intense than male expressions. Results are discussed in terms of universal and culture-specific aspects of emotion recognition, their relation to previous emotion recognition research findings, implications for training in applied psychology (i.e., counseling, clinical, and school), and future research projects.

,94,X,experts vs intermediates vs novices,diagnoses,Jaarsma,2014,Expertise under the microscope: processing histopathological slides,"ObjectivesAlthough the obvious goal of training in clinical pathology is to bring forth capable diagnosticians, developmental stages and their characteristics are unknown. This study therefore aims to find expertise-related differences in the processing of histopathological slides using a combination of eye tracking data and verbal data. 

MethodsParticipants in this study were 13 clinical pathologists (experts), 12 pathology residents (intermediates) and 13 medical students (novices). They diagnosed 10 microscopic images of colon tissue for 2seconds. Eye movements, the given diagnoses, and the vocabulary used in post hoc verbal explanations were registered. Eye movements were analysed according to changes over trial time and the processing of diagnostically relevant areas. The content analysis of verbal data was based on a categorisation system developed from the literature. 

ResultsAlthough experts and intermediates showed equal levels of diagnostic accuracy, their visual and cognitive processing differed. Whereas experts relied on their first findings and checked the image further for other abnormalities, intermediates tended to double-check their first findings. In their explanations, experts focused on the typicality of the tissue, whereas intermediates mainly mentioned many specific pathologies. Novices looked less often at the relevant areas and were incomplete, incorrect and inconclusive in their explanations. Their diagnostic accuracy was correspondingly poor. 

ConclusionsThis study indicates that in the case of intermediates and experts, different visual and cognitive strategies can result in equal levels of diagnostic accuracy. Lessons for training underline the relevance of the distinction between normal and abnormal tissue for novices, especially when the mental rotation of 2-D images is required. Intermediates need to be trained to see deviations in abnormalities. Feedback and an educational design that is specific to these developmental stages might improve training.

,96,X,police experience,shooting decision,Johnson,2018,How prior information and police experience impact decisions to shoot,"Social psychologists have relied on computerized shooting tasks to test whether race influences decisions to shoot. These studies reveal that under some conditions untrained individuals shoot unarmed Black men more than unarmed White men. We modeled the decision to shoot as a sequential sampling process in which people start out with prior biases and accumulate evidence over time until a threshold is reached, prompting a decision. We used this approach to test how prior information (a proxy for police dispatch information) and police experience influence racial bias in shooting decisions. When no prior information was given, target race biased the rate at which untrained civilians accumulated evidence, leading to a greater rate of shooting Black targets. For sworn police officers, the race of the target impacted prior bias, but not evidence accumulation. Moreover, officers showed no race bias in the observed decision to shoot. For both untrained civilians and sworn police officers, prior information about a target’s race was sufficient to eliminate racial bias in shooting decisions both at the process and behavioral level. These studies reveal that factors present in real-world shooting decisions (dispatch information and police experience) can moderate the role that race plays both in the underlying cognitive processes and ultimately on the observed decision. We discuss the benefits of using a dynamic cognitive model to understand the decision to shoot and the implications of these results for laboratory analogues of real-world decisions.

This study aimed at developing and validating a test to assess diagnostic accuracy, collected information, and diagnostic decision time in clinical reasoning. A norm-referenced computer-based test for the assessment of clinical reasoning (ASCLIRE) was developed, integrating the entire clinical decision process. In a cross-sectional study participants were asked to choose as many diagnostic measures as they deemed necessary to diagnose the underlying disease of six different cases with acute or sub-acute dyspnea and provide a diagnosis. 283 students and 20 content experts participated. In addition to diagnostic accuracy, respective decision time and number of used relevant diagnostic measures were documented as distinct performance indicators. The empirical structure of the test was investigated using a structural equation modeling approach. Experts showed higher accuracy rates and lower decision times than students. In a cross-sectional comparison, the diagnostic accuracy of students improved with the year of study. Wrong diagnoses provided by our sample were comparable to wrong diagnoses in practice. We found an excellent fit for a model with three latent factors-diagnostic accuracy, decision time, and choice of relevant diagnostic information-with diagnostic accuracy showing no significant correlation with decision time. ASCLIRE considers decision time as an important performance indicator beneath diagnostic accuracy and provides evidence that clinical reasoning is a complex ability comprising diagnostic accuracy, decision time, and choice of relevant diagnostic information as three partly correlated but still distinct aspects.

9,115,X,junior doctors vs consultants,prescribing errors,Lewis,2014,Exploring the causes of junior doctors' prescribing mistakes: a qualitative study,"AIMS 

Prescribing errors are common and can be detrimental to patient care and costly. Junior doctors are more likely than consultants to make a prescribing error, yet there is only limited research into the causes of errors. The aim of this study was to explore the causes of prescribing mistakes made by doctors in their first year post graduation. 

METHODS 

As part of the EQUIP study, interviews using the critical incident technique were carried out with 30 newly qualified doctors. Participants were asked to discuss in detail any prescribing errors they had made. Participants were purposely sampled across a range of medical schools (18) and hospitals (15). A constant comparison approach was taken to analysis and Reason's model of accident causation was used to present the data. 

RESULTS 

More than half the errors discussed were prescribing mistakes (errors due to the correct execution of an incorrect plan). Knowledge-based mistakes (KBMs) appeared to arise from poor knowledge of practical aspects of prescribing such as dosing, whereas rule-based mistakes (RBMs) resulted from inappropriate application of knowledge. Multiple error-producing and latent conditions were described by participants for RBMs and KBMs. Poor/absent senior support and a fear of appearing incompetent occurred with KBMs. Following erroneous routines or seniors' orders were major contributory factors in RBMs. 

CONCLUSIONS 

Although individual factors such as knowledge and expertise played a role in prescribing mistakes, there were many perceived interrelated factors contributing to error. We conclude that multiple interventions are necessary to address these and further research is essential.",BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,78,310,319,Web of Science,"Lewis, Penny J.; Ashcroft, Darren M.; Dornan, Tim; Taylor, David; Wass, Val; Tully, Mary P.",
,117,X,high vs low experience domains,fMRI,Lieberman,2004,Evidence-Based and Intuition-Based Self-Knowledge: An fMRI Study,"Behavioral and neuropsychological studies have suggested multiple self-knowledge systems may exist (i.e., evidence-based and intuition-based self-knowledge); however, little is known about the nature of intuition-based self-knowledge. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, the neural correlates of intuition-based and evidence-based self-knowledge were investigated. Participants with high and low experience in different domains (soccer and acting) made self-descriptiveness judgments about words from each domain while being scanned. High-experience domain judgments produced activation in a network of neural structures called the X-system, involved in automatic social cognition, whereas low-experience domain judgments produced activations in a network called the C-system, involved in effortful social cognition and propositional thought. The affective and slow-changing nature of intuition-based self-knowledge is discussed.

,118,X,Music experts v non-experts,Recognition of emotional prosody,Lima,2011,Speaking to the trained ear: Musical expertise enhances the recognition of emotions in speech prosody,"Language and music are closely related in our minds. Does musical expertise enhance the recognition of emotions in speech prosody? Forty highly trained musicians were compared with 40 musically untrained adults (controls) in the recognition of emotional prosody. For purposes of generalization, the participants were from two age groups, young (18–30 years) and middle adulthood (40–60 years). They were presented with short sentences expressing six emotions—anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise—and neutrality, by prosody alone. In each trial, they performed a forced-choice identification of the expressed emotion (reaction times, RTs, were collected) and an intensity judgment. General intelligence, cognitive control, and personality traits were also assessed. A robust effect of expertise was found: musicians were more accurate than controls, similarly across emotions and age groups. This effect cannot be attributed to socioeducational background, general cognitive or personality characteristics, because these did not differ between musicians and controls; perceived intensity and RTs were also similar in both groups. Furthermore, basic acoustic properties of the stimuli like fundamental frequency and duration were predictive of the participants' responses, and musicians and controls were similarly efficient in using them. Musical expertise was thus associated with cross-domain benefits to emotional prosody. These results indicate that emotional processing in music and in language engages shared resources.

Six older graphic designers, 6 normal older adults, 6 younger graphic design students, and 6 normal younger students participated in a 19-session program with a cued-recall variant of the Method of Loci. Older graphic designers attained higher levels of mnemonic performance than normal older adults but were not able to reach younger adults' level of performance; a perfect separation of age groups was achieved. Spatial visualization was a good predictor of mnemonic performance. Results suggest that negative adult age differences in imagery-based memory are attenuated but not eliminated by the advantages associated with criterion-relevant ability (talent) and experience.

The objective of the study was to determine whether it is feasible to develop a valid and reliable evaluation approach using medical simulation to assess technical and cognitive skills of physicians performing coronary interventions. 

Methods: Clinical case scenarios were developed by a committee of subject matter experts, who defined key decision nodes, such as stent positioning, and introduced unanticipated complications, such as coronary perforation. Subjects were 115 physicians from 10 U.S. healthcare institutions at three levels of expertise: novice, skilled, or expert. Subjects completed a questionnaire, one practice case and six test cases on a SimSuite simulator (Medical Simulation Corporation, Denver, CO), and an opinion survey. Clinical specialists rated subjects' procedural skills. 

Results: A technical and cognitive skills evaluation of performance in interventional cardiology procedures using medical simulation yielded results that distinguished between a novice group and skilled or expert groups (P < 0.0011 and scores correlated moderately with clinical specialist ratings of subjects' procedural skills and with number and complexity of procedures performed in practice during the previous year. Approximately 90% of subjects generally thought that the cases were well simulated and presented situations encountered in practice. 

Conclusions: This study suggests that an evaluation approach using high-fidelity medical simulation to assess technical and cognitive skills of physicians performing interventional cardiology procedures can be used to identify physicians who are extremely poor performers and not likely to be providing appropriate patient care. We believe that use of a high-fidelity simulator incorporating situations with multiple events, immediate feedback, and high sensory load would complement the results of traditional written examinations of medical knowledge to provide a more comprehensive assessment of physician ability in interventional cardiology.

,122,X,Expert radiologists v. novice,Visual processing,Litchfield,2016,Worth a quick look? Initial scene previews can guide eye movements as a function of domain-specific expertise but can also have unforeseen costs,"Rapid scene recognition is a global visual process we can all exploit to guide search. This ability is thought to underpin expertise in medical image perception yet there is no direct evidence that isolates the expertise-specific contribution of processing scene previews on subsequent eye movement performance. We used the flash-preview moving window paradigm (Castelhano &amp; Henderson, 2007) to investigate this issue. Expert radiologists and novice observers underwent 2 experiments whereby participants viewed a 250-ms scene preview or a mask before searching for a target. Observers looked for everyday objects from real-world scenes (Experiment 1), and searched for lung nodules from medical images (Experiment 2). Both expertise groups exploited the brief preview of the upcoming scene to more efficiently guide windowed search in Experiment 1, but there was only a weak effect of domain-specific expertise in Experiment 2, with experts showing small improvements in search metrics with scene previews. Expert diagnostic performance was better than novices in all conditions but was not contingent on seeing the scene preview, and scene preview actually impaired novice diagnostic performance. Experiment 3 required novice and experienced observers to search for a variety of abnormalities from different medical images. Rather than maximizing the expertise-specific advantage of processing scene previews, both novices and experienced radiographers were worse at detecting abnormalities with scene previews. We discuss how restricting access to the initial glimpse can be compensated for by subsequent search and discovery processing, but there can still be costs in integrating a fleeting glimpse of a medical scene.

A series of experiments investigated whether radiographers benefit from knowing where another person looked for pulmonary nodules, and whether the expertise of the model providing the search behavior was a contributing factor. Experiment 1 compared the diagnostic performance of novice and experienced radiographers examining chest x-rays and found that both groups performed better when shown the search behavior of either a novice radiographer or an expert radiologist. Experiment 2 established that benefits in performance only arose when the eye movements shown were related to the search for nodules; however, only the novices' diagnostic performance consistently improved when shown the expert's search behavior. Experiment 3 reexamined the contribution of task, image, and the expertise of the model underlying this benefit. Consistent with Experiment 1, novice radiographers were better at identifying nodules when shown either a naïve's search behavior or an expert radiologist's search behavior, but they demonstrated no improvement when shown a naïve model not searching for nodules. Our results suggest that although the benefits of this form of attentional guidance may be short-lived, novices can scaffold their decisions based on the search behavior of others.

,127,X,assistant referees vs players,offsides calls in football (soccer),Luis del Campo,2018,The influence of refereeing experiences judging offside actions in football,"In this study we assessed the influence of previous embodied refereeing experience on perceptual strategies used for judging offside events in football. For this purpose, 11 assistant referees and 11 players watched a video projected image of 24 offside sequences on a screen (5 x 3 m) in a laboratory. All participants, who were experienced in football at an amateur level, were required to decide when they perceived a player to be offside during observed sequences, viewed from an assistant referees perspective. An ASL SE5000 eye tracker was used to analyze participants' visual behaviours. Our interpretation of the results is that the specific previous officiating experiences of the assistant referees may have attuned their visual search strategies, such that they displayed a higher number of fixations and greater percentage viewing time on the last defender. In contrast, the players fixated for longer on areas of no interest. Despite these variations in visual search behaviours, no differences were detected in the percentages of correct offside decisions, yet differences did emerge in the incorrect decisions made. Specifically, the assistant referees achieved similar rates of false alarms and misses, and the players showed a bias towards calling offside when it was not offside. The assistant referees also missed more offside events and the players falsely flagged more events as offside in error. Further work is needed to clarify effects of these embodied officiating experiences in decision-making when participants with different experiences (e.g., player or match official) are asked to judge offside events in football.",PSYCHOLOGY OF SPORT AND EXERCISE,37,139,145,Web of Science,"Luis del Campo, Vicente; Canelo Farinas, Aitor; Dominguez Marquez, Francisco Javier; Morenas Martin, Jesus",

Two studies investigated whether educating mock jurors about the NCRMD defence would change their attitudes toward the defence and verdict decisions. We also investigated potential differences between student and community samples in such cases. In Study 1, we found that educating jurors about the NCRMD defence led to more positive attitudes toward the defence, but it did not affect verdicts. In Study 2, we found no effect of NCRMD education on attitudes or verdict decisions. Results did reveal an effect of sample type on the ‘injustice and danger’ dimension of NCRMD attitudes, such that students had more positive attitudes toward the defence than did community members. Verdicts did not vary as a function of sample type, suggesting that students may be an acceptable proxy for mock jurors in these types of studies.

,131,X,Experienced vs inexperienced radiologists,Interpreting medical scans,Mallett,2014,Tracking Eye Gaze during Interpretation of Endoluminal Three-dimensional CT Colonography: Visual Perception of Experienced and Inexperienced Readers,"Purpose: To identify and compare key stages of the visual process in experienced and inexperienced readers and to examine how these processes are used to search a moving three-dimensional (3D) image and their relationship to false-negative errors. 

Materials and Methods: Institutional review board research ethics approval was granted to use anonymized computed tomographic (CT) colonographic data from previous studies and to obtain eye-tracking data from volunteers. Sixty-five radiologists (27 experienced, 38 inexperienced) interpreted 23 endoluminal 3D CT colonographic videos. Eye movements were recorded by using eye tracking with a desk-mounted tracker. Readers indicated when they saw a polyp by clicking a computer mouse. Polyp location and boundary on each video frame were quantified and gaze data were related to the polyp boundary for each individual reader and case. Pre-defined metrics were quantified and used to describe and compare visual search patterns between experienced and inexperienced readers by using multilevel modeling. 

Results: Time to first pursuit was significantly shorter in experienced readers (hazard ratio, 1.22 [95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.44]; P = .017) but other metrics were not significantly different. Regardless of expertise, metrics such as assessment, identification period, and pursuit times were extended in videos where polyps were visible on screen for longer periods of time. In 97% (760 of 787) of observations, readers correctly pursued polyps. 

Conclusion: Experienced readers had shorter time to first eye pursuit, but many other characteristics of eye tracking were similar between experienced and inexperienced readers. Readers pursued polyps in 97% of observations, which indicated that errors during interpretation of 3D CT colonography in this study occurred in either the discovery or the recognition phase, but rarely in the scanning phase of radiologic image inspection.

Based on differences between cognitive processes of experts and novices, we hypothesized that experts make in fact better decisions after consciously thinking about complex problems whereas novices may benefit from deliberation-without-attention. These hypotheses were confirmed in a study among doctors and medical students. They diagnosed complex and routine problems under three conditions, an immediate-decision condition and two delayed conditions: conscious thought and deliberation-without-attention. Doctors did better with conscious deliberation when problems were complex, whereas reasoning mode did not matter in simple problems. In contrast, deliberation-without-attention improved novices’ decisions, but only in simple problems. Experts benefit from consciously thinking about complex problems; for novices thinking does not help in those cases.

However, forensic scientists are increasingly being encouraged to assign probabilities to their observations in the form of a likelihood ratio. This study is the first to examine whether handwriting experts are able to estimate the frequency of US handwriting features more accurately than novices. The results indicate that the absolute error for experts was lower than novices, but the size of the effect is modest, and the overall error rate even for experts is large enough as to raise questions about whether their estimates can be sufficiently trustworthy for presentation in courts. When errors are separated into effects caused by miscalibration and those caused by imprecision, we find systematic differences between individuals.

Over a six-week period the experimental group studied training tapes consisting of 5 sets of 5 tackles, in each case with an expert providing his interpretation of the correct decision. The lowest ranked referees on the national panel significantly improved their percentage of correct decisions, becoming 17.43% more accurate in their decisions at the posttest.

Here we examined nonofficers, novice officers, and experienced officers’ response bias, confidence, and generalized communicative suspicion. In Experiment 1, novice officers aligned with nonofficers in terms of both generalized communicative suspicion scores and confidence, with both these groups scoring lower than experienced officers. Generalized communicative suspicion scores and veracity judgments were not significantly related for either sample. However, novice officers aligned with experienced officers in terms of judgments: both police groups were lie-biased, whereas nonofficers were truth-biased. These findings suggest that unlike experienced officers, who have embraced the police culture to a greater degree, novice officers are not dispositionally suspicious (generalized communicative suspicion); however, they are able to mirror the prototypical police behavior (deception judgments) in police-related contexts. Experiment 2 supported these notions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",Law and Human Behavior,40,169,181,PsycARTICLES," Masip, Jaume

,141,X,Board-certified v. Residents,Diagnosis & treatment accuracy,McBee,2017,Contextual factors and clinical reasoning: differences in diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning in board certified versus resident physicians,"Background: The impact of context on the complex process of clinical reasoning is not well understood. Using situated cognition as the theoretical framework and videos to provide the same contextual ""stimulus"" to all participants, we examined the relationship between specific contextual factors on diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning accuracy in board certified internists versus resident physicians. 
Methods: Each participant viewed three videotaped clinical encounters portraying common diagnoses in internal medicine. We explicitly modified the context to assess its impact on performance (patient and physician contextual factors). Patient contextual factors, including English as a second language and emotional volatility, were portrayed in the videos. Physician participant contextual factors were self-rated sleepiness and burnout.. The accuracy of diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning was compared with covariates using Fisher Exact, Mann-Whitney U tests and Spearman Rho's correlations as appropriate. 
Results: Fifteen board certified internists and 10 resident physicians participated from 2013 to 2014. Accuracy of diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning did not differ between groups despite residents reporting significantly higher rates of sleepiness (mean rank 20.45 vs 8.03, U = 0.5, p < .001) and burnout (mean rank 20.50 vs 8.00, U = 0.0, p < .001). Accuracy of diagnosis and treatment were uncorrelated (r = 0.17, p = .65). In both groups, the proportion scoring correct responses for treatment was higher than the proportion scoring correct responses for diagnosis. 
Conclusions: This study underscores that specific contextual factors appear to impact clinical reasoning performance. Further, the processes of diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning, although related, may not be interchangeable. This raises important questions about the impact that contextual factors have on clinical reasoning and provides insight into how clinical reasoning processes in more authentic settings may be explained by situated cognition theory.",BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,17,,,Web of Science,"McBee, Elexis; Ratcliffe, Temple; Picho, Katherine; Schuwirth, Lambert; Artino, Anthony R., Jr.; Yepes-Rios, Ana Monica; Masel, Jennifer; van der Vleuten, Cees; Durning, Steven J.",

However, it is possible to contend that skill-based training could be associated with an increase, a decrease, or no change in risk-taking behavior. In 3 experiments, the authors examined the influence of a skill-based training program (hazard perception) on the risk-taking behavior of car drivers (using video-based driving simulations). Experiment 1 demonstrated a decrease in risk taking for novice drivers. In Experiment 2, the authors examined the possibilities that the skills training might operate through either a nonspecific reduction in risk taking or a specific improvement in hazard perception. Evidence supported the latter. These findings were replicated in a more ecological context in Experiment 3, which compared advanced and nonadvanced police drivers.

Structure strategy training increased the amount of information remembered as well as recall of the most important information. This training affected the organization of recall and was critical for producing readers who could use the structure strategy consistently across a variety of expository texts. In addition, it helped learners use signals in text more effectively. There was an additive effect of training plus signaling for use of the structure strategy consistently across five passages. The strategy switch hypothesis was supported, indicating that signaling affects encoding rather than retrieval processes. The findings have implications for both reading and writing.

We created two ""serious"" video game training interventions to improve that judgment. The interventions’ central theoretical construct was the representativeness heuristic, which, in trauma triage, would mean judging the severity of an injury by how well it captures (or ""represents"") the key features of archetypes of cases requiring transfer to a trauma center. Drawing on clinical experience, medical records, and an expert panel, we identified features characteristic of representative and nonrepresentative cases. The two interventions instantiated both kinds of cases. One was an adventure game, seeking narrative engagement; the second was a puzzle-based game, emphasizing analogical reasoning. Both incorporated feedback on diagnostic errors, explaining their sources and consequences. In a four-arm study, they were compared with an intervention using traditional text-based continuing medical education materials (active control) and a no-intervention (passive control) condition. A sample of 320 physicians working at nontrauma centers in the United States was recruited and randomized to a study arm. The primary outcome was performance on a validated virtual simulation, measured as the proportion of undertriaged patients, defined as ones who had severe injuries (according to American College of Surgeons guidelines) but were not transferred. Compared with the control group, physicians exposed to either game undertriaged fewer such patients [difference = −18%, 95% CI: −30 to −6%, P = 0.002 (adventure game); −17%, 95% CI: −28 to −6%, P = 0.003 (puzzle game)]; those exposed to the text-based education undertriaged similar proportions (difference = +8%, 95% CI: −3 to +19%, P = 0.15).

In Exp 1, older (mean age 66.6 yrs) and younger (mean age 29.0 yrs) pilots and age-matched nonpilots read typical ATC messages (e.g., commands to change aircraft heading). After each message, they read back (repeated) the commands, which is a routine ATC procedure requiring short-term memory. Ss also performed less domain-relevant tasks. Expertise eliminated age differences in repeating heading commands but did not reduce age differences for the less relevant tasks. In Exp 2, expertise reduced but did not eliminate age differences in repeating heading commands from spoken messages. Results suggest that expertise compensates age declines in resources when the task is highly domain relevant.

They chose referents for sentences referring to a protagonist or minor character mentioned 1 sentence (recent character) or 3 sentences (distant character) before this target sentence. All groups chose referents less accurately for sentences about distant and minor characters than about recent and protagonist characters, perhaps because these referents were less likely to be in working memory. Young readers and pilots were more accurate for distant and minor character target sentences in aviation narratives and recalled aviation narratives more accurately. Expertise did not reduce age differences. Expertise differences may reflect decreased demands on working memory capacity, and age declines may reflect reduced capacity.

The capability of expert and near-expert rugby players as well as novices to anticipate skill type within rugby (learning sport) was first examined using a temporal occlusion paradigm. Participants watched video footage of an opponent performing rugby skill types that were temporally occluded at different points in the opponent’s action and then made a written prediction. Thereafter, the capability of participants to transfer their anticipation skill to predict pitch type in baseball (transfer sport) was examined. Participants watched video footage of a pitcher throwing different pitch types that were temporally occluded and made a written prediction. Results indicated that expert and near-expert rugby players anticipated significantly better than novices across all occlusion conditions. However, none of the skill groups were able to transfer anticipation skill to predict pitch type in baseball. The findings of this paper, along with existing literature, support the theoretical prediction that transfer of perceptual anticipation is expertise dependent and restricted to similar domains.

In contrast, the role and importance of contextual information in anticipation has received only minimal attention. We evaluate the importance of contextual information in anticipation and examine the underlying perceptual-cognitive processes. We present skilled and less-skilled tennis players with normal video or animated footage of the same rallies. In the animated condition, sequences were created using player movement and ball trajectory data, and postural information from the players was removed, constraining participants to anticipate based on contextual information alone. Participants judged ball bounce location of the opponent’s final occluded shot. The 2 groups were more accurate than chance in both display conditions with skilled being more accurate than less-skilled (Exp. 1) participants. When anticipating based on contextual information alone, skilled participants employed different gaze behaviors to less-skilled counterparts and provided verbal reports of thoughts which were indicative of more thorough evaluation of contextual information (Exp. 2). Findings highlight the importance of both postural and contextual information in anticipation and indicate that perceptual-cognitive expertise is underpinned by processes that facilitate more effective processing of contextual information, in the absence of postural information.

,162,X,novice vs expert soccer player,option generation and selection,Musculus,2018,"Do the best players ""take-the-first""? Examining expertise differences in the option-generation and selection processes of young soccer players","Expertise research in sports has established expert–novice differences in the decision-making of adults. Yet, little is known about whether expertise differences in decision making, that is, option generation and selection, are already evident in young players. To inform talent identification and development, this study investigated differences between young expert (n = 86) and near-expert soccer players (n = 83) regarding the option-generation and selection processes predicted by the Take-The-First (TTF) heuristic. Further, based on ecological rationality, the effect of time pressure on young players’ option generation and selection was examined. Young players’ (N = 169; Mage = 11.32, SDage = 1.77) option-generation and selection processes were assessed in a video-based soccer task using temporal occlusion. It was revealed that young expert players generated fewer options and selected the first as the best option more often than near-experts. This result underlines the importance of considering option generation when investigating expertise development. In addition, time pressure promoted the generation of fewer but better options and fostered the use of the Take-The-First heuristic. Thus, the present study highlights the ability of young players to adapt their decision strategy to the situation and theoretically extends decision-making research in sports by specifying the effect of time pressure. Further, practical implications for theory-based diagnostics and decision-making training are discussed.

A sample of 104 Evangelical Christians leaders were found to score poorly in moral reasoning using this approach, but were also found to have high moral identity. Their moral identity correlated highly with self-reported moral behavior, yet their moral decision-making did not, suggesting moral identity is more salient than decision-making in their moral development. A subsample of 10 who scored low on moral decision-making but high on other moral indicators was qualitatively found to have a sophisticated morality based on different assumptions than used in past research. These findings are discussed in terms of bias in past research using moral dilemmas that denigrate religious conservatives.

In the article, the URL published for the supplemental material was incorrect. The correct URL is http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0014947.supp] Previous research has found age-related deficits in a variety of cognitive processes. However, some studies have demonstrated age-related sparing on tasks where individuals have substantial experience, often attained over many decades. Here, the authors examined whether decades of experience in a fast-paced demanding profession, air traffic control (ATC), would enable older controllers to perform at high levels of proficiency. The authors also investigated whether older controllers would show diminished age-related decrements on domain-relevant cognitive abilities. Both young and old controllers and noncontrollers performed a battery of cognitive and ATC tasks. Results indicate that although high levels of experience can reduce the magnitude of age-related decline on the component processes that underlie complex task performance, this sparing is limited in scope. More important, however, the authors observed experience-based sparing on simulated ATC tasks, with the sparing being most evident on the more complex air traffic control tasks. These results suggest that given substantial experience, older adults may be quite capable of performing at high levels of proficiency on fast-paced demanding real-world tasks. The implications of these findings for global skilled labor shortages are discussed.

Expert forensic interviewers and novices watched videotapes of children who either lied or told the truth about their parent's transgression, rendered a dichotomous judgment of whether the child lied, rated their confidence in that judgment, and rated the children on various characteristics. Adults detected lies with greater than chance—but not impressive—accuracy, regardless of expertise level. Older children's lies were more detectable by experts than were younger children's. Adults were more confident in their judgments about older than younger children. Confidence in lie/truth judgments was not significantly correlated with actual lie detection accuracy.

While there has been suggestion in the literature that the same might apply to bitemarks - a form of identification evidence in which a degree of contextual information during the comparison phase is generally unavoidable there have so far been no empirical studies to test this assertion. We explored dental and non-dental students' ability to state whether two bitemarks matched, while manipulating task ambiguity and the presence and emotional intensity of additional contextual information. Provision of the contextual information influenced participants' decisions on the ambiguous bitemarks. Interestingly, when participants were presented with highly emotional images and subliminally primed with the words 'same' and 'guilty', they made fewer matches relative to our control condition. Dental experience also played a role in decision-making, with dental students making more matches as the experiment progressed, regardless of context or task ambiguity. We discuss ways that this exploratory research can be extended in future studies. (C) 2013 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

,176,X,experts vs residents,error detection and correction,Patel,2011,Recovery at the edge of error: Debunking the myth of the infallible expert,"The notion that human error should not be tolerated is prevalent in both the public and personal perception of the performance of clinicians. However, researchers in other safety-critical domains have long since abandoned the quest for zero defects as an impractical goal, choosing to focus instead on the development of strategies to enhance the ability to recover from error. This paper presents a cognitive framework for the study of error recovery, and the results of our empirical research into error detection and recovery in the critical care domain, using both laboratory-based and naturalistic approaches. Both attending physicians and residents were prone to commit, detect and recover from errors, but the nature of these errors was different. Experts corrected the errors as soon as they detected them and were better able to detect errors requiring integration of multiple elements in the case. Residents were more cautious in making decisions showing a slower error recovery pattern, and the detected errors were more procedural in nature with specific patient outcomes. Error detection and correction are shown to be dependent on expertise, and on the nature of the everyday tasks of the clinicians concerned. Understanding the limits and failures of human decision-making is important if we are to build robust decision-support systems to manage the boundaries of risk of error in decision-making. Detection and correction of potential error is an integral part of cognitive work in the complex, critical care workplace. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A process-tracing methodology analyzed operators' concurrent verbalizations and actions during simulated fault scenarios. In Study 1, training increased awareness of multiple faults and provided a heuristic for switching to a representation that included multiple-fault hypotheses. Training had no effect on diagnostic accuracy, although fewer incorrect single-fault hypotheses were regenerated. In Study 2, operators practiced identifying the inconsistencies between a single-fault hypothesis and fault symptoms and modifying this hypothesis into a consistent multiple-fault hypothesis. Training improved diagnostic accuracy because of improved hypothesis modification processes.

Background: Expert radiologists precisely and rapidly allocate visual attention on pulmonary nodules chest radiographs. Moreover, the most frequent accurate decisions are produced in the shortest viewing time, thus, the first hundred milliseconds of image perception seems be crucial for correct interpretation. Medical image perception model assumes that during holistic analysis experts extract information based on low spatial frequency (SF) components and creates a mental map of suspicious location for further inspection. The global impression results in flagged regions for detailed inspection with foveal vision. Method: Nine chest experts and nine non-chest radiologists viewed two sets of randomly ordered chest radiographs under 2 timing conditions: (1) 300ms; (2) free search in unlimited time. The same radiographic cases of 25 normal and 25 abnormal digitalized chest films constituted two image sets: low-pass filtered and unfiltered. Subjects were asked to detect nodules and rank confidence level. MRMC ROC DBM analyses were conducted. Results: Experts had improved ROC AUC while high SF components are displayed (p=0.03) or while low SF components were viewed under unlimited time (p=0.02) compared with low SF 300mSec viewings. In contrast, non-chest radiologists showed no significant changes when high SF are displayed under flash conditions compared with free search or while low SF components were viewed under unlimited time compared with flash.

Multiple studies demonstrate nurse practitioners are as effective as doctors when managing chronic conditions and minor illnesses and injuries. No studies have focused on how nurse practitioners compare to doctors in their management of complex cases presenting for the first time. 

Objective: This study assessed how nurse practitioners' diagnostic reasoning abilities when managing a complex case compared to those of doctors'? 

Design: A comparative research design. 

Participants: Purposeful sampling recruited 30 nurse practitioners and 16 doctors working in multiple specialties in New Zealand. All doctors were completing postgraduate specialist training programmes. Specialties included older adults, emergency care, primary health care/general practice, cardiology, respiratory and palliative care. 

Methods: A complex case scenario assessed by an expert panel and think aloud protocol was used to assess diagnostic reasoning abilities. The ability of 30 nurse practitioners to determine diagnoses, identify the problem, and propose actions was compared to that of 16 doctors. Correct responses were determined by an expert panel. Data gained from the case scenario using think aloud protocol were quantified for analysis. 

Results: 61.9% of doctors identified the correct diagnoses, 56.3% the problem and 34.4% the actions as determined by the expert panel. This compares to 54.7% of nurse practitioners identifying the correct diagnoses, 53.3% the problem and 35.8% the actions. Analysis revealed no difference between these groups (diagnoses 95% CI: -1.76 to -0.32, p = 0.17, problem chi(2) = 0.00, p = 1.0, or actions 95% CI: -1.23 to 1.58, p = 0.80). 

Conclusion: Nurse practitioners' diagnostic reasoning abilities compared favourably to those of doctors in terms of diagnoses made, problems identified and action plans proposed from a complex case scenario. In times of global economic restraints this adds further support to alternative models of care. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to enhance the decision-making skills of assistant referees by further developing their ability to (1) time slice the incoming information flow into series of isolated time frames during an ongoing offside situation and (2) use this information to mentally read off the spatial positions of the key-role players. Training (n=10) and control groups (n=10) were exposed to a pre- and post-test, consisting of an offside decision-making and frame recognition test. In the latter, assistant referees were asked to indicate which of five photos best represented the spatial position of the defender and attacker at the moment of the pass. Only the training group received 12 web-based offside training sessions. First, the training group improved in mentally freezing, holding and scanning the mental picture of the offside situation in short-term memory from pre- to post-test, as evidenced by an increased recognition accuracy. Second, the improvement in recognition accuracy resulted in enhanced performance on the offside decision-making task.

,187,X,International assistant referees vs amateur soccer players ,Response accuracy ,Put,2013,Experts in offside decision making learn to compensate for their illusory perceptions,"In association football, the flash-lag effect appears to be a viable explanation for erroneous offside decision making. Due to this spatiotemporal illusion, assistant referees (ARs) perceive the player who receives the ball ahead of his real position. In this experiment, a laboratory decision-making task was used to demonstrate that international top-class ARs, compared with amateur soccer players, do not have superior perceptual sensitivity. They clearly modify their decision criterion according to the contextual needs and, therefore, show a higher response bias toward not responding to the stimulus, in particular in the most difficult situations. Thus, international ARs show evidence for response-level compensation, resulting in a specific cost (i.e., more misses), which clearly reflects the use of particular (cognitive) strategies. In summary, it appears that experts in offside decision making can be distinguished from novices more on the cognitive or decision-making level than on the perceptual level.

Psychophysiological and performance data obtained from 10 advanced and 10 intermediate-level players were completed. A total of 400 pitches (200 fastballs, 200 curveballs) was randomly presented via a large projection screen, and participants pressed one of two buttons to indicate the type of pitch thrown. Verbal precues were given for 300 of the pitches. Of those, 75% were valid, and 25% were invalid. Electroencephalographic data collected from the P-z location was used to assess the latency and amplitude of P300. Analysis of variance (Skill Level x Precue x Pitch) for P300 and reaction time (RT) indicated that intermediate batters produced shorter P300 latencies, larger P300 amplitudes, longer RTs, and less correct responses than the advanced batters; the effects were more pronounced for the curveballs. These results suggest that intermediate batters are less in their perceptual decision-making due to greater limitations in attentional capacity when compared with advanced batters.

Although common sense and most theories imply that experienced intelligence professionals should be less prone to irrational inconsistencies than college students, we show the opposite. Moreover, the growth of experience-based intuition predicts this developmental reversal . We presented intelligence agents, college students, and postcollege adults with 30 risky-choice problems in gain and loss frames and then compared the three groups’ decisions. The agents not only exhibited larger framing biases than the students, but also were more confident in their decisions. The postcollege adults (who were selected to be similar to the students) occupied an interesting middle ground, being generally as biased as the students (sometimes more biased) but less biased than the agents. An experimental manipulation testing an explanation for these effects, derived from fuzzy-trace theory, made the students look as biased as the agents. These results show that, although framing biases are irrational (because equivalent outcomes are treated differently), they are the ironical output of cognitively advanced mechanisms of meaning making.

A gaze-contingent display was used to selectively present information to the central and peripheral areas of the visual field while participants performed a decision-making task. Eleven skilled and eleven less-skilled male basketball players watched video clips of basketball scenarios in three different viewing conditions: full-image control, moving window (central vision only), and moving mask (peripheral vision only) At the conclusion of each clip participants were required to decide whether it was more appropriate for the ball-carrier to pass the ball or to drive to the basket. The skilled players showed significantly higher response accuracy and faster response times compared with their lesser-skilled counterparts in all three viewing conditions, demonstrating superiority in information extraction that held irrespective of whether they were using central or peripheral vision. The gaze behaviour of the skilled players was less influenced by the gaze-contingent manipulations, suggesting they were better able to use the remaining information to sustain their normal gaze behaviour. The superior capacity of experts to interpret dynamic visual information is evident regardless of whether the visual information is presented across the whole visual field or selectively to either central or peripheral vision alone.

The 31 nursing students in the control group also received a 4-hour interactive session on a nondecision analysis topic. A posttest experimental design was selected to minimize testing bias. Three clinical case studies were developed, tested, and utilized for data collection. Subjects in the experimental group selected clinical decisions that were in accordance with clinical decisions made by experts more often and more consistently than did subjects in the control group (p less than .0001).

,203,X,Expert vs novice marksmen ,Behavioral performance and response time ,Sherwin,2015,Experience Does Not Equal Expertise in Recognizing Infrequent Incoming Gunfire: Neural Markers for Experience and Task Expertise at Peak Behavioral Performance,"For a soldier, decisions to use force can happen rapidly and sometimes lead to undesired consequences. In many of these situations, there is a rapid assessment by the shooter that recognizes a threat and responds to it with return fire. But the neural processes underlying these rapid decisions are largely unknown, especially amongst those with extensive weapons experience and expertise. In this paper, we investigate differences in weapons experts and non-experts during an incoming gunfire detection task. Specifically, we analyzed the electroencephalography (EEG) of eleven expert marksmen/soldiers and eleven non-experts while they listened to an audio scene consisting of a sequence of incoming and non-incoming gunfire events. Subjects were tasked with identifying each event as quickly as possible and committing their choice via a motor response. Contrary to our hypothesis, experts did not have significantly better behavioral performance or faster response time than novices. Rather, novices indicated trends of better behavioral performance than experts. These group differences were more dramatic in the EEG correlates of incoming gunfire detection. Using machine learning, we found condition-discriminating EEG activity among novices showing greater magnitude and covering longer periods than those found in experts. We also compared group-level source reconstruction on the maximum discriminating neural correlates and found that each group uses different neural structures to perform the task. From condition-discriminating EEG and source localization, we found that experts perceive more categorical overlap between incoming and non-incoming gunfire. Consequently, the experts did not perform as well behaviorally as the novices. We explain these unexpected group differences as a consequence of experience with gunfire not being equivalent to expertise in recognizing incoming gunfire.",PLOS ONE,10,,,Web of Science,"Sherwin, Jason Samuel; Gaston, Jeremy Rodney",
,204,X,Expert cello players vs non musicians ,Number of anomalous musical events ,Sherwin,2013,Musical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise,"Humans are extremely good at detecting anomalies in sensory input. For example, while listening to a piece of Western-style music, an anomalous key change or an out-of-key pitch is readily apparent, even to the non-musician. In this paper we investigate differences between musical experts and non-experts during musical anomaly detection. Specifically, we analyzed the electroencephalograms (EEG) of five expert cello players and five non-musicians while they listened to excerpts of J.S. Bachâ€™s Prelude from Cello Suite No . 1. All subjects were familiar with the piece, though experts also had extensive experience playing the piece. Subjects were told that anomalous musical events (AMEs) could occur at random within the excerpts of the piece and were told to report the number of AMEs after each excerpt. Furthermore, subjects were instructed to remain still while listening to the excerpts and their lack of movement was verified via visual and EEG monitoring. Experts had significantly better behavioral performance (i.e. correctly reporting AME counts) than non-experts, though both groups had mean accuracies greater than 80%. These group differences were also reflected in the EEG correlates of key-change detection post-stimulus, with experts showing more significant, greater magnitude, longer periods of, and earlier peaks in condition-discriminating EEG activity than novices. Using the timing of the maximum discriminating neural correlates, we performed source reconstruction and compared significant differences between cellists and non-musicians. We found significant differences that included a slightly right lateralized motor and frontal source distribution. The right lateralized motor activation is consistent with the cortical representation of the left handâ€”i.e. the hand a cellist would use, while playing, to generate the anomalous key-changes. In general, these results suggest that sensory anomalies detected by experts may in fact be partially a result of an embodied cognition, with a model of the action for generating the anomaly playing a role in its detection.

,206,X,Experts v laypeople,Assessing risk in food hazards,Siegrist,2018,Risk Prioritization in the Food Domain Using Deliberative and Survey Methods: Differences between Experts and Laypeople,"This study examined how experts and laypeople using both a deliberative and a survey method prioritized 28 hazards related to food and everyday items. To enable them to make deliberative decisions, participants received detailed descriptions of the hazards. The participants prioritized the hazards before and after a group discussion, in which the group's average prioritization was discussed. The rankings of the hazards before and after the group discussion were highly correlated. However, laypeople and experts differed significantly in their rankings for 18 of the 28 hazards. Trust and confidence were important predictors for laypeople's risk rankings. To test the influence of the deliberative method (e.g., providing detailed information about each hazard), data from a second group of laypeople were collected with a no-information survey. This group did not receive specific information about the hazards. The risk rankings of the laypeople who received information were highly correlated with the risk rankings of laypeople who did not receive information. Overall, the results suggest that deliberative methods of risk-ranking or no-information survey methods with no information about hazards provide similar results among laypeople. The conclusion is that government agencies should not only base their risk prioritization on evidence from risk assessments but also need to consider laypeople's hazard rankings. This procedure may result in an efficient and publicly accepted risk management strategy.",RISK ANALYSIS,38,504,524,Web of Science,"Siegrist, Michael; Hubner, Philipp; Hartmann, Christina",

Subjects (N = 34) from a beginning/intermediate tennis class were randomly assigned to either a mental quickness or a physical quickness (control) training group. They were tested in three laboratory tennis simulation tasks and three on-court tasks (serves, ground strokes, and volleys) 1 week before and after the 3-week quickness training program. Quickness Training x Gender x Test Session (2 x 2 x 2) ANOVAs with repeated measures on the third factor were conducted. For the laboratory tasks, the mental quickness group made faster decisions in reaction to serves, exhibited faster anticipation times, and showed improved accuracy in predicting serve type and location. No improvements in accuracy were found for the physical quickness group. For filmed match-play situations. the mental quickness group improved reaction times with training and committed fewer response errors.

Students and community members ( N  = 125) were instructed before the evidence, after the evidence, both before and after the evidence, or not instructed at all. Two clear benefits of pretrial instruction emerged: Jurors instructed both before and after trial were better able to integrate facts and law, and preinstructed jurors more often deferred their verdict decisions until after the trial. Furthermore, preinstruction did not impair jurors' information processing or decision making in any way. These results suggest that important benefits of substantive preinstruction can be realized without apparent cost to jurors' performance.

Moderately experienced clinicians (N = 98) and very experienced clinicians (n = 126) were randomly assigned to reading a referral letter suggesting either depression or anxiety, or no referral letter. They then read a psychiatric report about a depressed patient, and gave a preliminary and final diagnosis. Results showed that the correctness of the diagnoses by very experienced clinicians was unaffected by the referral diagnosis. Moderately experienced clinicians did use the suggested diagnosis as anchor; when they had read a referral letter suggesting depressive complaints they were more inclined to classify the patient with a depressive disorder. In conclusion, the diagnosis in a referral letter influences the diagnostic decision made by moderately experienced clinicians.

,215,X,elite vs sub-elite referees,performance on various tasks,Spitz,2018,The role of domain-generic and domain-specific perceptual-cognitive skills in association football referees,"Objectives: We examined the importance of perceptual-cognitive skills in association football referees. Design and method: Using a novel approach, elite (n = 22) and sub-elite referees (n = 21) completed an extended test battery of perceptual-cognitive measures. Participants were assessed using both domain-generic (e.g., sustained attention; working memory) and domain-specific (e.g., pattern recognition) perceptual-cognitive measures within the domain of refereeing. Results: A multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences between groups on the following domain-specific perceptual-cognitive skill measures, with elite referees performing significantly better than their sub-elite counterparts: overall decision-making performance; anticipation; and recall capacity. No significant differences were reported between the elite and sub-elite referees on domain-generic perceptual-cognitive skill measures. A stepwise discriminant analysis highlighted that a combination of five predictor variables, including four domain-specific and one domain-generic perceptual-cognitive skill measure, significantly discriminated elite and sub-elite referees, with 90.7% of referees being classified correctly. Conclusions: Our findings shed light on the skills underpinning perceptual-cognitive expertise in referees and are consistent with the existing findings on expert outfield players. Implications are discussed with regard to testing and training programs for referees and across other professional domains.

,216,X,Expert eye care clinicians vs novice eye care clinicians ,Decision speed,Stainer,2015,Examination strategies of experienced and novice clinicians viewing the retina,"PurposeExpertise in viewing medical images is thought to be due to the ability to process holistic image information. Eye care clinicians can inspect photographs of the retina to search for signs of disease. However, they commonly also view the eye invivo using the restricted view of a slit lamp, which removes the potential benefits of holistic processing. We investigated how expert and novice clinicians inspect the fundus using these two methods. 

MethodsTwenty clinicians (10 experienced, 10 novices) examined 64 photographs of human retinae. Each participant viewed half of the images as fundus photographs while having their eye position recorded. The other half were viewed via a simple slit lamp simulation, whereby a computer mouse was used to control the position of a viewing window that revealed the underlying fundus photograph. 

ResultsExperienced clinicians made decisions significantly faster than novices, with faster decision-making when viewing the fundus photograph compared to via the slit lamp simulation. The distribution of inspection was similar, although novices spent longer examining the optic nerve head than other regions. Experienced clinicians showed significantly earlier inspection of the optic nerve head when it was judged to be unhealthy. 

ConclusionsOur results support the idea that experienced eyecare clinicians use holistic image information, if available, when inspecting the fundus. This was particularly prominent for the optic nerve head region, which was the region that novices spent most of their time examining. Holistic processing benefits were only present in experts' free-viewing fundus photographs; the limited field of view from the slit lamp disrupts such global image benefits.",OPHTHALMIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL OPTICS,35,424,432,Web of Science,"Stainer, Matthew J.; Anderson, Andrew J.; Denniss, Jonathan",
,220,X,military officers training levels (novice vs expert),gaze parameters and scan management skills,Sullivan,2011,Training simulation for helicopter navigation by characterizing visual scan patterns,"Introduction: Helicopter overland navigation is a cognitively complex task that requires continuous monitoring of system and environment parameters and years of training. This study investigated potential improvements to training simulation by analyzing the influences of flight expertise on visual scan patterns. Methods: There were 12 military officers who varied in flight expertise as defined by total flight hours who participated in overland navigation tasks. Their gaze parameters were tracked via two eye tracking systems while subjects were looking at out-the-window (OTW) and topographic Map views in a fixed based helicopter simulator. Results: Flight performance measures were not predicted by the expertise level of pilots. However, gaze parameters and scan management skills were predicted by the expertise level. For every additional 1000 flight hours, on average, the model predicted the median dwell will decrease 28 ms and the number of view changes will increase 33 times. However, more experienced pilots scanned more OTW than novice pilots, which was contrary to our expectation. A visualization tool (FEST: Flight and Eye Scan visualization Tool) to replay navigation tasks and corresponding gaze data was developed. Qualitative analysis from FEST revealed visual scan patterns of expert pilots not only looking ahead on the map, but also revisiting areas on the map they just flew over to retain confidence in their orientation. Discussion: Based on the analysis provided above, this work demonstrates that neurophysiological markers, such as eye movements, can be used to indicate the aspects of a trainee's cognitive state that are useful for cuing an instructional system.

The corrected Table 1 is present in the erratum.] The goal was to examine the differences in visual search strategies between expert and nonexpert baseball batters during the preparatory phase of a pitcher's pitching and accuracy and timing of swing judgments during the ball's trajectory. 14 members of a college team (Expert group), and graduate and college students (Nonexpert group), were asked to observe 10 pitches thrown by a pitcher and respond by pushing a button attached to a bat when they thought the bat should be swung to meet the ball (swing judgment). Their eye movements, accuracy, and the timing of the swing judgment were measured. The Expert group shifted their point of observation from the proximal part of the body such as the head, chest, or trunk of the pitcher to the pitching arm and the release point before the pitcher released a ball, while the gaze point of the Nonexpert group visually focused on the head and the face. The accuracy in swing judgments of the Expert group was significantly higher, and the timing of their swing judgments was significantly earlier. Expert baseball batters used visual search strategies to gaze at specific cues (the pitching arm of the pitcher) and were more accurate and relatively quicker at decision making than Nonexpert batters.

,224,X,surgeons,whether that surgeon would have the surgery,Tanweer,2015,Neurosurgical decision making: personal and professional preferences,"OBJECT Physicians are often solicited by patients or colleagues for clinical recommendations they would make for themselves if faced by a clinical situation. The act of making a recommendation can alter the clinical course being taken. The authors sought to understand this dynamic across different neurosurgical scenarios by examining how neurosurgeons value the procedures that they offer. 

METHODS The authors conducted an online survey using the Congress of Neurological Surgeons listserv in May 2013. Respondents were randomized to answer either as the surgeon or as the patient. Questions encompassed an array of distinct neurosurgical scenarios. Data on practice parameters and experience levels were also collected. 

RESULTS Of the 534 survey responses, 279 responded as the ""neurosurgeon"" and 255 as the ""patient."" For both vestibular schwannoma and arteriovenous malformation management, more respondents chose resection for their patient but radiosurgery for themselves (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). Aneurysm coiling was chosen more often than clipping, but those whose practice was >= 30% open cerebrovascular neurosurgery were less likely to choose coiling. Overall, neurosurgeons who focus predominantly on tumors were more aggressive in managing the glioma, vestibular schwannoma, arteriovenous malformation, and trauma. Neurosurgeons more than 10 years out of residency were less likely to recommend surgery for management of spinal pain, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, and trauma scenarios. 

CONCLUSIONS In the majority of cases, altering the role of the surgeon did not change the decision to pursue treatment. In certain clinical scenarios, however, neurosurgeons chose treatment options for themselves that were different from what they would have chosen for (or recommended to) their patients. For the management of vestibular schwannomas, arteriovenous malformations, intracranial aneurysms, and hypertensive hemorrhages, responses favored less invasive interventions when the surgeon was the patient. These findings are likely a result of cognitive biases, previous training, experience, areas of expertise, and personal values.",JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY,122,678,691,Web of Science,"Tanweer, Omar; Wilson, Taylor A.; Kalhorn, Stephen P.; Golfinos, John G.; Huang, Paul P.; Kondziolka, Douglas",

,228,X,"experts, intermediate trainee, new trainee, novice",performance on fingerprint discrimination task,Thompson,2014,Human matching performance of genuine crime scene latent fingerprints,"There has been very little research into the nature and development of fingerprint matching expertise. Here we present the results of an experiment testing the claimed matching expertise of fingerprint examiners. Expert ( n = 37), intermediate trainee ( n = 8), new trainee ( n = 9), and novice ( n = 37) participants performed a fingerprint discrimination task involving genuine crime scene latent fingerprints, their matches, and highly similar distractors, in a signal detection paradigm. Results show that qualified, court-practicing fingerprint experts were exceedingly accurate compared with novices. Experts showed a conservative response bias, tending to err on the side of caution by making more errors of the sort that could allow a guilty person to escape detection than errors of the sort that could falsely incriminate an innocent person. The superior performance of experts was not simply a function of their ability to match prints, per se , but a result of their ability to identify the highly similar, but nonmatching fingerprints as such. Comparing these results with previous experiments, experts were even more conservative in their decision making when dealing with these genuine crime scene prints than when dealing with simulated crime scene prints, and this conservatism made them relatively less accurate overall. Intermediate trainees—despite their lack of qualification and average 3.5 years experience—performed about as accurately as qualified experts who had an average 17.5 years experience. New trainees—despite their 5-week, full-time training course or their 6 months experience—were not any better than novices at discriminating matching and similar nonmatching prints, they were just more conservative. Further research is required to determine the precise nature of fingerprint matching expertise and the factors that influence performance. The findings of this representative, lab-based experiment may have implications for the way fingerprint examiners testify in court, but what the findings mean for reasoning about expert performance in the wild is an open, empirical, and epistemological question.

We describe a joint experimental and computational modeling approach to examine the similarities and differences in the cognitive processes of novice participants and experienced participants (pathology residents and pathology faculty) in cancer cell image identification. For this study we collected a bank of hundreds of digital images that were identified by cell type and classified by difficulty by a panel of expert hematopathologists. The key manipulations in our study included examining the speed-accuracy tradeoff as well as the impact of prior expectations on decisions. In addition, our study examined individual differences in decision-making by comparing task performance to domain general visual ability (as measured using the Novel Object Memory Test (NOMT) (Richler et al. Cognition 166:42–55, 2017). Using signal detection theory and the diffusion decision model (DDM), we found many similarities between experts and novices in our task. While experts tended to have better discriminability, the two groups responded similarly to time pressure (i.e., reduced caution under speed instructions in the DDM) and to the introduction of a probabilistic cue (i.e., increased response bias in the DDM). These results have important implications for training in this area as well as using novice participants in research on medical image perception and decision-making.

The E shot more accurately than the R (E 74.60%; R 53.80%) and made fewer decisions errors in the cell condition when 18.50% of E and 61.50% of R fired at the assailant. E and R did not differ in duration of the draw/aim/fire phases, but the R's motor onsets were later, during the final second compared to the E's final 2.5 s. Across the final six fixations the E increased the percent of fixations on the assailant's weapon/cell to 71% and to 86% on hits, compared to a high of 34% for the R.

,241,X,"investigators, students,  investigation managers",triage decision making,Walsh,2018,Triage Decision-Making by Welfare Fraud Investigators,"Two studies explored triage decision-making in a welfare fraud investigation, specifically decisions concerning what evidence to collect when deciding whether to pursue a case to prosecution or to issue a warning only. An observational study revealed that triage decisions appear to be determined by subjective estimates of the ease of evidence collection and that these estimates are influenced by complexity of mapping evidence onto fraud types. This hypothesis was explored in an experimental study of investigators, managers, and students choosing evidence to inform triage decisions for cases that varied according to relevance and complexity. Student selections were unaffected by the nature of the case. In contrast, with a simple fraud case, investigators and managers tended to select evidence to support a prosecution decision, but with complex fraud they selected evidence that supported comparative evaluation of prosecution and warning decisions. The results demonstrate flexible expertise in choosing what evidence to sample. 
General Audience Summary 
Fraud is common in welfare claims and costs taxpayers billions of dollars, but little is known about decision making strategies used in welfare fraud investigation. Investigations begin with a triage decision: whether to seek evidence that might lead to prosecution or to terminate an investigation and issue a warning designed to discourage further claims. The first study explored the fraud investigation process through field notes and analysis of investigator interviews with clients. The study showed that investigators tend to make triage decisions based on the perceived ease with which evidence can be collected. A second experimental study compared choices made by investigators, investigation managers, and students as to what evidence they would seek to make a triage decision. Participants were shown case scenarios based on a tip-off that suggested fraud. Their task was to choose further evidence in order to decide whether to prosecute or issue a warning. Cases differed in how easy it was to map evidence onto the underlying fraud activity. Students' selections were unaffected by the nature of the case. In contrast, with a simple fraud case, investigators selected evidence to support prosecution, but with a complex fraud case they selected evidence that could equally support prosecution and warning decisions. The results suggest that investigators are flexible in the strategies they use in triage decision-making: they will seek evidence to discriminate between alternative outcomes but only when the case is complex, otherwise they tend to seek evidence to confirm initial suspicions.",JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN MEMORY AND COGNITION,7,82,91,Web of Science,"Walsh, David; Dando, Coral J.; Ormerod, Thomas C.",

Effects of professional experience and time pressure on passport-matching performance,"Despite extensive research on unfamiliar face matching, little is known about factors that might affect matching performance in real-life scenarios. We conducted 2 experiments to investigate the effects of several such factors on unfamiliar face-matching performance in a passport-check scenario. In Experiment 1, we assessed the effect of professional experience on passport-matching performance. The matching performance of 96 German Federal Police officers working at Munich Airport was compared with that of 48 novices without specific face-matching experience. Police officers significantly outperformed novices, but nevertheless missed a high ratio of frauds. Moreover, the effects of manipulating specific facial features (with paraphernalia like glasses and jewelry, distinctive features like moles and scars, and hairstyle) and of variations in the physical distance between the faces being matched were investigated. Whereas manipulation of physical distance did not have a significant effect, manipulations of facial features impaired matching performance. In Experiment 2, passport-matching performance was assessed in relation to time constraints. Novices matched passports either without time constraints, or under a local time limit (which is typically used in laboratory studies), or under a global time limit (which usually occurs during real-life border controls). Time pressure (especially the global time limit) significantly impaired matching performance.

Even though CPT has provided many descriptively excellent decision models, there have also been some empirical results persistently problematic for CPT accounts. The tension between the normative prescription of CPT and human behavior is particularly acute in cases where we have higher expectations for rational decisions. One such case concerns legal decision making from legal experts, such as attorneys and prosecutors and, more so, judges. In the present research we explore one of the most influential CPT decision fallacies, the conjunction fallacy (CF), in a legal decision making task, involving assessing evidence that the same suspect had committed two separate crimes. The information for the two crimes was presented consecutively. Each participant was asked to provide individual ratings for the two crimes in some cases and conjunctive probability rating for both crimes in other cases, after all information had been presented. Overall, 360 probability ratings for guilt were collected from 120 participants, comprised of 40 judges, 40 attorneys and prosecutors, and 40 individuals without legal education. Our results provide evidence for a double conjunction fallacy (in this case, a higher probability of committing both crimes than the probability of committing either crime individually), in the group of individuals without legal education. These results are discussed in terms of their applied implications and in relation to a recent framework for understanding such results, quantum probability theory (QPT).

While research has examined visual search processes in other aspects of medical decision making (e.g., radiology), this is the first study to apply the paradigm to ECG interpretation. The secondary aim is to explore the role that clinical history plays in influencing visual search behavior and diagnostic decision making. While clinical history may aid diagnostic decision making, it may also bias the visual search process. Methods: Ten final-year medical students and 10 consultant emergency medics were presented with 16 ECG traces (8 with clinical history that was not manipulated independently of case) while wearing eye tracking equipment. The ECGs represented common abnormalities encountered in emergency departments and were among those taught to final-year medical students. Participants were asked to make a diagnosis on each presented trace and report their level of diagnostic confidence. Results: Experts made significantly faster, more accurate, and more confident diagnoses, and this advantage was underpinned by differences in visual search behavior. Specifically, experts were significantly quicker at locating the leads of critical importance. Contrary to our hypothesis, clinical history had no significant effect on the readers’ ability to detect the abnormality or make an accurate diagnosis. Conclusions: Accurate ECG interpretation appears dependent on the perceptual skill of pattern recognition and specifically the time to fixate the critical lead(s). Therefore, there is potential clinical utility in developing perceptual training programs to train novices to detect abnormalities more effectively.

In the current study, we investigate the role that knowledge about writing characters plays in visual word processing in skilled adult readers. While there is clear neuropsychological evidence against the strong version of the hypothesis that reading depends on writing in Chinese even once literacy is acquired, it is still possible that writing could have a modulatory influence on how visually presented Chinese characters are processed in literate readers. The present study addressed this hypothesis using a visual same/different judgment task on pairs of characters that vary in how similar the 2 characters are visually and how similar they are in terms of motor plan, using 24 expert readers and writers of Chinese and 24 naïve participants with no prior experience with written Chinese as subjects. The results of linear mixed-effects modeling indicate that the speed of same/different judgments is influenced by visual similarity, but not by how similar they are written, even in the group of skilled readers. These results suggest that knowledge of how Chinese characters are written does not influence visual character processing in skilled readers.

9,263,X,Senior internal medicine residents ,Diagnostic errors,ALQahtani,2016,Does Time Pressure Have a Negative Effect on Diagnostic Accuracy?,"PURPOSE:
Studies suggest time pressure has negative effects on physicians' working conditions and may lead to suboptimal patient care and medical errors. Experimental evidence supporting this is lacking, however. This study investigated the effect of time pressure on diagnostic accuracy.

METHOD:
In 2013, senior internal medicine residents at three hospitals in Saudi Arabia were divided randomly into two groups: a time-pressure condition and a control condition without time pressure. Both groups diagnosed eight written clinical cases presented on computers. In the time-pressure condition, after completing each case, participants received information that they were behind schedule. Response time was recorded, and diagnostic accuracy was scored.

RESULTS:
The 23 participants in the time-pressure condition spent significantly less time diagnosing the cases (mean = 96.00 seconds) than the 19 control participants (mean = 151.97 seconds) (P < .001). Participants under time pressure had a significantly lower diagnostic accuracy score (mean = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.23-0.43) than participants without time pressure (mean = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42-0.60) (F[1, 41] = 6.90, P = .012, Î· = 0.15). This suggests participants in the time-pressure condition made on average 37% more errors than control participants.

CONCLUSIONS:
Time pressure has a negative impact on diagnostic performance. The authors propose that the effect of time pressure on diagnostic accuracy is moderated by both the case difficulty level and the physician's level of experience. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that time pressure affects diagnostic accuracy only if cases are not too difficult and physicians' expertise level is intermediate.",ACADEMIC MEDICINE,91,710,716,Web of Science,"ALQahtani, Dalal A.; Rotgans, Jerome I.; Mamede, Silvia; ALAlwan, Ibrahim; Magzoub, Mohi Eldin M.; Altayeb, Fatheya M.; Mohamedani, Manahil A.; Schmidt, Henk G.",

Prior research in the area of police performance reveals that psychological and physiological stress responses during critical incidents can shape the outcome of the incident, either positively or negatively. The goal of this study was to test a training method to improve use of force decision making among police. This randomized controlled pilot study consisted of training officers to apply techniques to enhance psychological and physiological control during stressful critical incidents. Of a pool of 80 police officers, potential participants were invited based on equivalent age, years of experience, physiological characteristics (i.e., body mass index [BMI] and cardiovascular reactivity), and expertise. Results revealed that the intervention group displayed significantly better physiological control, situational awareness, and overall performance, and made a greater number of correct use of force decisions than officers in the control group (all ps < .01). The relevant improvements in use of force decision-making found in this pilot study indicate that this training method warrants further investigation.

,266,X,Expert vs. novice,Accuracy and response time,Annis,2018,Modeling memory dynamics in visual expertise,"The development of visual expertise is accompanied by enhanced visual object recognition memory within an expert domain. We aimed to understand the relationship between expertise and memory by modeling cognitive mechanisms. Participants with a measured range of birding expertise were recruited and tested on memory for birds (expert domain) and cars (novice domain). Participants performed an old-new continuous recognition memory task whereby on each trial an image of a bird or car was presented that was either new or had been presented earlier with lag j. The Linear Ballistic Accumulator model (LBA; Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008) was first used to decompose accuracy and response time (RT) into drift rate, response threshold, and nondecision time, with the measured level of visual expertise as a potential covariate on each model parameter. An Expertise × Category interaction was observed on drift rates such that expertise was positively correlated with memory performance recognizing bird images but not car images as old versus new. To then model the underlying processes responsible for variation in drift rate with expertise, we used a model of drift rates building on the Exemplar-Based Random Walk model (Nosofsky, Cox, Cao, &amp; Shiffrin, 2014; Nosofsky &amp; Palmeri, 1997), which revealed that expertise was associated with increases in memory strength and increases in the distinctiveness of stored exemplars. Taken together, we provide insight using formal cognitive modeling into how improvements in recognition memory with expertise are driven by enhancements in the representations of objects in an expert domain.

To compare triage level assignment of the RNs and PEPs to that done by a panel of experts using the same P-CTAS guidelines. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey (55 case scenarios) was sent to all RNs and PEPs working in the emergency department after the P-CTAS was implemented. Participants were instructed to assign a triage level for each case. A priori, all cases were assigned a triage level by a panel of experts using the P-CTAS guidelines. Kappa statistics and the mean number (+/-1SD) of correct responses were calculated. Results: A response rate of 85% was achieved (29 RNs, 15 PEPs). The kappa level of agreement (95% Cl) among RNs was 0.51 (0.50-0.52) and was 0.39 (0.38-0.41) among PEPs (P < 0.001).

Innovative and accessible training adjuncts are required to help to meet training needs. Cognitive task analysis has been used extensively to train pilots and in other surgical specialties. However, the use of cognitive task analyses within orthopaedics is in its infancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel cognitive task analysis tool to train novice surgeons in diagnostic knee arthroscopy in high-fidelity, phantom-limb simulation. 
Methods: Three expert knee surgeons were interviewed independently to generate a list of technical steps, decision points, and errors for diagnostic knee arthroscopy. A modified Delphi technique was used to generate the final cognitive task analysis. A video and a voiceover were recorded for each phase of this procedure. These were combined to produce the Imperial Knee Arthroscopy Cognitive Task Analysis (IKACTA) tool that utilizes written and audiovisual stimuli to describe each phase of a diagnostic knee arthroscopy. In this double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, a power calculation was performed prior to recruitment. Sixteen novice orthopaedic trainees who performed <= 10 diagnostic knee arthroscopies were randomized into 2 equal groups.

Despite the centrality of these concepts to dispositional decision making, virtually no information or guidelines exist describing how juvenile court judges or mental health professionals should weigh these constructs when making vivid line distinctions with respect to transfer. The authors asked judges (N = 361) from the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges to examine a hypothetical case that varied the level of dangerousness, sophistication-maturity, and treatment amenability. Results showed that dangerousness and sophistication-maturity had a significant impact on transfer, whereas amenability to treatment did not. Policy implications for this important area of law and psychology are threefold: (a) Although individualized assessments may be preferred, key to such evaluations are specific guidelines for weighing Kent criteria; (b) eventually, a national standard should be adopted to outline how to weigh criteria and to reduce disparity across states; and (c) psychologists should continue to refine juvenile assessment technology and ultimately the information they provide courts.

Often known as deceptive movements, these unpredictable patterns of body movement can give a competitive advantage to an attacker when trying to outwit a defender. In this particular study, we immersed novice and expert rugby players in an interactive virtual rugby environment to understand how the dynamics of deceptive body movement influence a defending playerâ€™s decisions about how and when to act. When asked to judge final running direction, expert players who were found to tune into prospective tau-based information specified in the dynamics of â€˜honestâ€™ movement signals (Centre of Mass), performed significantly better than novices who tuned into the dynamics of â€˜deceptiveâ€™ movement signals (upper trunk yaw and out-foot placement) (p<.001). These findings were further corroborated in a second experiment where players were able to move as if to intercept or â€˜tackleâ€™ the virtual attacker. An analysis of action responses showed that experts waited significantly longer before initiating movement (p<.001). By waiting longer and picking up more information that would inform about future running direction these experts made significantly fewer errors (p<.05). In this paper we not only present a mathematical model that describes how deception in body-based movement is detected, but we also show how perceptual expertise is manifested in action expertise. We conclude that being able to tune into the â€˜honestâ€™ information specifying true running action intention gives a strong competitive advantage.",PLOS ONE,7,,,Web of Science,"Brault, Sebastien; Bideau, Benoit; Kulpa, Richard; Craig, Cathy M.",

Yet, it is still unclear if this bias is influenced by expertise. In Study 1, computer experts estimated the distribution of Internet concepts and general knowledge concepts among students. These estimations were compared with norm values and with estimations obtained from a sample of laypersons. Laypersons showed a stronger bias than experts. Study 2 revealed that knowledge estimations can be influenced by labeling knowledge items as specialist knowledge. The results are suggestive of ways in which communication between experts and laypersons could be enhanced. Especially in asynchronous communication situations, as for example in the use of e-mail based hot lines, if experts are to communicate effectively, they must make accurate assumptions about laypersons' knowledge of the topic.

Diagnosis of similar cases was facilitated more than that of dissimilar cases in the same diagnostic category, demonstrating that facilitation was not solely due to activation of the diagnostic category as a whole. Because diagnosis was posed in a multiple-choice format that always included the correct diagnosis, the relative disadvantage of dissimilar items was not due to the unavailability of the category name. The similarity effect also occurred with 2-wk delay between the initial case and the test cases. Variations in diagnostic procedure, ranging from giving a quick 1st impression to arguing for given alternative diagnoses before selection, did not interact with the effect of similarity. This result suggests that the similarity effect is not strongly dependent on a particular diagnostic strategy.

In an exploratory study, we examine the interrelationships between the decisions made by elite netball umpires, the potential contextual and environmental influences (e.g., crowd size), and the umpires' dispositional tendencies specifically, their propensity to deliberate and ruminate on their decisions. 
Design/Method: Filmed footage from 60 England Netball Superleague matches was coded using performance analysis software. We measured the number of decisions made overall, and for home and away teams; league position; competition round; match quarter; and crowd size. Additionally, 10 umpires who officiated in the matches completed the Decision-Specific Reinvestment Scale (DSRS).",PSYCHOLOGY OF SPORT AND EXERCISE,31,52,60,Web of Science,"Burnett, Adele M.; Bishop, Daniel T.; Ashford, Kelly J.; Williams, A.

9,298,X,Doctors,Diagnostic errors analyzing ECG,Cairns,2016,A computer-human interaction model to improve the diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making during 12-lead electrocardiogram interpretation,"Introduction: The 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) presents a plethora of information and demands extensive knowledge and a high cognitive workload to interpret. Whilst the ECG is an important clinical tool, it is frequently incorrectly interpreted. Even expert clinicians are known to impulsively provide a diagnosis based on their first impression and often miss co-abnormalities. Given it is widely reported that there is a lack of competency in ECG interpretation, it is imperative to optimise the interpretation process. Predominantly the ECG interpretation process remains a paper based approach and whilst computer algorithms are used to assist interpreters by providing printed computerised diagnoses, there are a lack of interactive human-computer interfaces to guide and assist the interpreter. 

Methods: An interactive computing system was developed to guide the decision making process of a clinician when interpreting the ECG. The system decomposes the interpretation process into a series of interactive sub-tasks and encourages the clinician to systematically interpret the ECG. We have named this model 'Interactive Progressive based Interpretation' (IPI) as the user cannot 'progress' unless they complete each sub-task. Using this model, the ECG is segmented into five parts and presented over five user interfaces (1: Rhythm interpretation, 2: Interpretation of the P-wave morphology, 3: Limb lead interpretation, 4: QRS morphology interpretation with chest lead and rhythm strip presentation and 5: Final review of 12-lead ECG). The IPI model was implemented using emerging web technologies (i.e. HTML5, CSS3, AJAX, PHP and MySQL). It was hypothesised that this system would reduce the number of interpretation errors and increase diagnostic accuracy in ECG interpreters. To test this, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians when they used the standard approach (control cohort) with clinicians who interpreted the same ECGs using the IPI approach (IPI cohort). 

Results: For the control cohort, the (mean; standard deviation; confidence interval) of the ECG interpretation accuracy was (45.45%; SD = 18.1%; CI = 42.07, 48.83). The mean ECG interpretation accuracy rate for the IPI cohort was 58.85% (SD = 42.4%; Cl = 49.12, 68.58), which indicates a positive mean difference of 13.4%. (Cl = 4.45, 22.35) An N - 1 Chi-square test of independence indicated a 92% chance that the IPI cohort will have a higher accuracy rate. Interpreter self-rated confidence also increased between cohorts from a mean of 4.9/10 in the control cohort to 6.8/10 in the IPI cohort (p = 0.06). Whilst the IPI cohort had greater diagnostic accuracy, the duration of ECG interpretation was six times longer when compared to the control cohort. 

Conclusions: We have developed a system that segments and presents the ECG across five graphical user interfaces. Results indicate that this approach improves diagnostic accuracy but with the expense of time, which is a valuable resource in medical practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

,301,X,novice vs. expert trainees,CBT decision-making,Carpenter,2016,Assessing cognitive-behavioral clinical decision-making among trainees in the treatment of childhood anxiety,"Supported treatments are not broadly available, prompting the need for effective training of front-line providers. Observational methods for assessing training success are resource- and time-intensive, and brief self-reports of comprehension are prone to bias and poor correspondence with practice. The present study presents a preliminary psychometric evaluation of a novel alternative method to assessing trainee comprehension of and clinical reasoning in cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) for child anxiety disorders, the Assessment of Clinical decision-making in Evidence-based treatment for Child Anxiety and Related and Disorders (ACE CARD). The ACE CARD, developed in consultation with a panel of child anxiety experts, presents respondents with clinical vignettes describing prototypical anxious youth at various points of CBT treatment and has respondents select which of 4 response options is most consistent with the CBT model of child anxiety treatment. In a sample of novice trainees and experts in CBT for anxiety (N = 54), results suggest the measure can discriminate across levels of clinical expertise. Experts performed significantly better than trainees (d = .60, p &lt; .001), although 3 of the vignettes were largely responsible for group differences. Future iterations of the ACE CARD are needed to remove items with poor discriminating properties and to add additional items with greater difficulty. With continued support, vignette-based assessment approaches may prove to have a meaningful role in dissemination efforts as brief, resource-efficient proxies of CBT competence.

A Tobii T120 Eye Tracker was used to record the eye movements. Two hypotheses for explaining incorrect decisions were investigated, namely, the flash-lag effect and the shift of gaze. Performance differences between skill levels were also examined. First, results showed a bias toward flag errors for national ARs as expected by the flash-lag effect. Second, ARs fixated the offside line before, during, and after the precise moment the pass was given, implying there was no shift of gaze from the passer to the receiving attacker. Third, no differences were found in scan patterns between international and national ARs. In conclusion, international ARs seem to have found a strategy to better deal with the perceptual illusion resulting from the flash-lag effect. Based on their experience, they have learned to correct for this illusion, and, consequently, show fewer flag errors.

It is important to determine if the same factors influence the flying performance and the landing decision making and to uncover which factors, among the pilot's cognitive status, personality traits, and experience, are the most predictive. We examined in 24 general aviation pilots the relationship between those factors and the flying performance and weather-related decision-making relevance. The cognitive assessment encompassed the three basic executive functions (Miyake et al., 2000), reasoning, and psychomotor velocity. The personal characteristics were age, flight experience, and level of impulsivity. Reasoning, updating in working memory, and flight experience were predictive of the flight performance. In addition, updating in working memory, flight experience, and level of impulsivity were linked with weather-related decision-making relevance.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AVIATION PSYCHOLOGY,21,217,234,Web of Science,"Causse, Mickael; Dehais, Frederic; Pastor, Josette",

Baseball pitchers and batters at both advanced and intermediate levels were asked to make a decision about whether to swing the bat when viewing a series of videos showing incomplete sequences of a model pitcher throwing a strike or a ball. The results revealed that first 100 ms of ball flight could discriminate advanced batters from intermediate pitchers and batters (with no difference between intermediate pitchers and batters). Particularly, advanced batters (perceptual experts with regard to pitching action) were statistically more accurate and less uncertain in making decisions than were intermediate players, whereas advanced pitchers (motor experts) only showed this tendency without reaching a statistically significant level. Moreover, advanced batters demonstrated greater perceptual sensitivity in discriminating when to swing at strikes over balls than all other players. Our findings suggested that when players were above intermediate level, perceptual experience of an observed action facilitated the perceptual anticipation to a greater extent than motor experience of producing it.

Consequently, the authors assessed the effect of querying initial hypotheses on diagnostic performance. Method: In 2007, the authors randomly assigned 67 first-year medical students from the University of Calgary to two groups and asked them to diagnose eight common problems. The authors presented the same primary data to both groups and asked students for their initial diagnosis. Then, after presenting secondary data that were either discordant or concordant with the primary data, they asked students for a final diagnosis. The authors noted changes in students' diagnoses and the accuracy of initial and final diagnoses for discordant and concordant cases. Results: For concordant cases, students retained 84.2% of their initial diagnoses and were equally likely to move toward a correct as incorrect final diagnosis (6.9% versus 8.9%, P = .3); no difference existed in the accuracy of initial and final diagnoses: 85.9% versus 84.0% (P = .4). By contrast, for discordant cases, students retained only 23.3% of initial diagnoses, change was almost invariably from incorrect to correct (76.3% versus 0.4%, P < .001), and final diagnoses were more accurate than initial diagnoses: 80.7% versus 4.8% (P < .001). Overall, no difference existed in the accuracy of final diagnoses for concordant and discordant cases (P < .18). Conclusions: These data suggest that querying an initial diagnostic hypothesis does not harm a correct diagnosis but instead allows students to rectify an incorrect diagnosis. Whether querying initial diagnoses reduces diagnostic error in clinical practice remains unknown.",ACADEMIC MEDICINE,85,1125,1129,Web of Science,"Coderre, Sylvain; Wright, Bruce; McLaughlin, Kevin",
,311,X,Police officers vs regular people,Shoot or not shoot,Correll,2007,Across the thin blue line: Police officers and racial bias in the decision to shoot,"Police officers were compared with community members in terms of the speed and accuracy with which they made simulated decisions to shoot (or not shoot) Black and White targets. Both samples exhibited robust racial bias in response speed. Officers outperformed community members on a number of measures, including overall speed and accuracy. Moreover, although community respondents set the decision criterion lower for Black targets than for White targets (indicating bias), police officers did not. The authors suggest that training may not affect the speed with which stereotype-incongruent targets are processed but that it does affect the ultimate decision (particularly the placement of the decision criterion). Findings from a study in which a college sample received training support this conclusion.

Three hundred forty two judges reviewed a forensic psychological report about a hypothetical defendant; only the defendant's age (12–17) and maturity level (mature, immature) varied across reports. Results revealed a main effect of age, with older juveniles generally deemed more competent, and a main effect of maturity, with mature juveniles generally deemed more competent. No interaction was found. Results suggest that age and maturity play major roles in judicial determinations of juvenile competency.

Eye-tracking is commonly used to examine observers' gaze behaviour during such medical image interpretation tasks, but analysis of eye movement sequences is limited. We therefore used ScanMatch, a novel technique that compares saccadic eye movement sequences, to examine the effect of expertise and diagnosis on the similarity of scanning patterns. Diagnostic accuracy was also recorded. Thirty-five participants were classified as Novices, Medics and Experts based on their level of expertise. Participants completed two brain tumour detection tasks. The first was a whole-brain task, which consisted of 60 consecutively presented slices from one patient; the second was an independent-slice detection task, which consisted of 32 independent slices from five different patients. Experts displayed the highest accuracy and sensitivity followed by Medics and then Novices in the independent-slice task. Experts showed the highest level of scanning pattern similarity, with medics engaging in the least similar scanning patterns, for both the whole-brain and independent-slice task. In the independent-slice task, scanning patterns were the least similar for false negatives across all expertise levels and most similar for experts when they responded correctly. These results demonstrate the value of using ScanMatch in the medical image perception literature. Future research adopting this tool could, for example, identify cases that yield low scanning similarity and so provide insight into why diagnostic errors occur and ultimately help in training radiologists.",COGNITIVE RESEARCH-PRINCIPLES AND IMPLICATIONS,3,,,Web of Science,"Crowe, Emily M.; Gilchrist, Iain D.; Kent, Christopher",

The type of referral problem did not influence the Ss' decisions; however, the nature of the assessment data had a significant impact. School psychologists who received data from normal children were less likely to hold low future academic expectations, to diagnose the child as handicapped, or to recommend a special education program. Psychologists in both groups were reluctant to label the case study child as handicapped and to recommend special class placement. Ss made decisions reflecting a least restrictive environment perspective, one that is consistent with the intent of current special education legislation.

Recent social comparison research has suggested that performance judgments may be influenced by judgments about a preceding performance. Specifically, performance judgments may be assimilated to judgments of the preceding performance if judges focus on similarities between the two. If judges focus on differences, however, contrast may ensue. The authors examined sequential performance judgments, using data gathered from the 2004 Olympic Games as well as data gathered in the laboratory with students or experienced gymnastics judges as participants. Sequential performance judgments were influenced by previously judged performances, and the direction of this influence depended on the degree of perceived similarity between the successive performances.

Participants were 142 college students (94 education majors and 48 business majors). The measure of domain knowledge was the number of courses completed in the major. Students recalled three different lists (control, education, and business) of 20 words. Knowledge effects were estimated controlling for academic aptitude, academic achievement, and general memory ability. Domain-specific knowledge consistently predicted recall, above and beyond the effect of these control variables. Moreover, nonlinear models better represented the relation between knowledge and memory, with very similar functions predicting recall in both knowledge domains. Specifically, early in the majors more classes corresponded with increased memory performance, but a plateau period, when more classes did not result in higher recall, was evident for both majors. Longitudinal research is needed to explore at what point in learning novices' performance begins to resemble experts' performance.

Although numerous studies have demonstrated their use in contexts ranging from consumers' shopping decisions to experts' estimations of experimental validity, virtually no published research has addressed heuristics use in problems involving genetic conditions and associated risk probabilities. The present research consists of two studies. In the first study, 220 undergraduates attempted to solve four genetic problems--two common heuristic problems modified to focus on genetic likelihood, and two created to study heuristics and probability rule application. Results revealed that the vast majority of undergraduates used heuristics and also demonstrated a complete misuse of probability rules. In the second study, 156 practicing genetic counselors and 89 genetic counseling students solved slightly modified versions of the genetic problems used in Study 1. Results indicated that a large percentage of both genetic counselors and students used heuristics, but the counselors demonstrated superior problem-solving performance compared to both the genetic counseling students and the undergraduates from Study 1.

Results were analyzed to determine features related to pilot attention distribution in processing tactical situation displays and their correspondence to tactical decision making. Evidence is provided for the effect of target quantity, target location, and overall target density distribution on decision making and attention. In addition, substantial variation in decision making was found between participants. Systematic biases in attention were also discovered which have implications for decision making in combat situations. Evidence of chunking in processing the displays was also explored.

The evidence order was completely counterbalanced and each witness represented a different type of testimony chosen in accordance with the legal practice. If judges rendered their verdict on the basis of the first witness, a primacy effect would be observed. Conversely, if the last testimony would be preponderant, a recency effect would influence their judgment. Results showed a recency effect based on a defence eyewitness whose placement in the last position provoked significantly less condemnations.

An experimental investigation,"Persons with mental disorder are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. Once involved in the criminal justice system, offenders with mental disorder are more likely to return to custody while on probation than their nondisordered counterparts, often for breaking the rules of community supervision. Risk assessments and risk management strategies employed by probation officers can lead to higher rates of returns to custody for probationers with mental disorder, and the current study is the first to examine these experimentally. Here, 234 probation officers provided risk assessments and risk management decisions based on a vignette portraying a probationer with mental disorder, substance abuse disorder, both, or neither. Although substance abuse is a relatively stronger risk factor than mental disorder, mental disorder had a stronger effect on officers' risk assessments. In terms of risk management, mental disorder had the strongest effect on officers' desire to manage risk with forced mental health treatment. These findings suggest that training for probation officers in the relative utility of mental disorder in predicting risk, in addition to evidence-based risk management strategies that take the focus off mental disorder, may improve outcomes for probationers with mental disorder.

9,348,X,medical experts,cervical cancer screenings,Evans,2011,Prevalence of Abnormalities Influences Cytologists' Error Rates in Screening for Cervical Cancer,"Context.-Medical screening tasks are often difficult, visual searches with low target prevalence (low rates of disease). Under laboratory conditions, when targets are rare, nonexpert searchers show decreases in false-positive results and increases in false-negative results compared with results when targets are common. This prevalence effect is not due to vigilance failures or target unfamiliarity. Objective.-To determine whether prevalence effects could be a source of elevated false-negative errors in medical experts. Design.-We studied 2 groups of cytologists involved in cervical cancer screening (Boston, Massachusetts, and South Wales, UK). Cytologists evaluated photomicrographs of cells at low (2% or 5%) or higher (50%) rates of abnormality prevalence. Two versions of the experiment were performed. The Boston, Massachusetts, group made decisions of normal or abnormal findings using a 4-point rating scale. Additionally, the group from South Wales localized apparent abnormalities. Results.-In both groups, there is evidence for prevalence effects. False-negative errors were 17% (higher prevalence), rising to 30% (low prevalence) in the Boston, Massachusetts, group. The error rate was 27% (higher prevalence), rising to 42% (low prevalence) in the South Wales group. (Comparisons between the 2 groups are not meaningful because the stimulus sets were different.) Conclusions.-These results provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that experts are not immune to the effects of prevalence even with stimuli from their domain of expertise. Prevalence is a factor to consider in screening for disease by human observers and has significant implications for cytology-based cervical cancer screening in the post-human papillomavirus vaccine era, when prevalence rates of high-grade lesions in the population are expected to decline.

,349,X,Experienced detectives vs novice doctors ,Quality of detectives decision making ,Fahsing,2016,The making of an expert detective: the role of experience in English and Norwegian police officers' investigative decision-making,"Biased decision-making in criminal investigations can impede or arrest the progress of justice. Previous research has not systematically addressed the effects of professional experience on the quality of detectives' decision-making. Using a quasi-experimental design, this study compared the quality of investigative decisions made by experienced detectives and novice police officers in two countries with markedly different models for the development of investigative expertise (England and Norway). Participants (N = 124) were presented with two semi-fictitious cases and were asked to report all relevant investigative hypotheses and necessary investigative actions in each case. The quality of participants' responses was gauged against a gold standard established by a panel of senior homicide experts. In the English sample, experienced detectives vastly outperformed novice police officers in the number of reported gold-standard investigative hypotheses and actions. In the Norwegian sample, however, experienced detectives did not perform any better than novices. We argue that English (vs. Norwegian) detectives may benefit more from professional experience due to their Professionalising Investigation Programme and a nationwide accreditation program, requiring them to engage in extensive standardized training, systematic evaluation and synchronized development. In contrast, Norway lacks such requirements. Methodological limitations and implications for police training and accreditation policies are discussed.

Counselors were required to base their judgements on information collected from patients during psychosocial history gathering, clinical interviews, physical examinations, brief cognitive screening tests, and substance abuse severity evaluations, but not on neuropsychological test results. All patients were subsequently administered a neuropsychological test battery. Diagnostic agreement between counselors' impressions of patients' cognitive status and patients' actual neuropsychological test performance was poor. Subsequent analyses revealed counselors' impressions about patients' neuropsychological functioning were based on information that did not reliably discriminate between cognitively impaired and intact patients (e.g., years of education and self-reported symptoms of cognitive dysfunction).

This experiment tests, via incentivization of a lab-based decision, the hypothesis that the NF effect reflects differential motivation applied to solving problems that differ in complexity. The study examines if incentive effects are moderated by task complexity and expertise and also explores the extent to which NF frames improve diagnostic understanding. Methods: Three-hundred and 25 participants (235 novices and 90 medical experts) were randomly allocated to a frame (NF vs. CP) by task difficulty (short vs. standard menus) by incentive (present vs. absent) between-subjects design. The task was to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV) of the hemoccult test for colorectal cancer. Effort, self-efficacy, and diagnostic understanding were assessed. Results: Incentives increased correct problem solving and the NF effect was replicated. The NF effect did not vary as a function of incentivization, but was slightly attenuated by task complexity and expertise. There was no evidence that effort mediated the incentive effect. The correct PPV (which is low) was associated with reduced trust in the test’s diagnostic accuracy. For those who committed errors, NF frames increased the likelihood of underestimating the PPV, with underestimation associated with greater trust in the test. Conclusions: The NF effect is robust to incentives supporting the use of NF frames in clinical settings. When errors occur, however, NF frames are linked to underestimation.

It is one of the sports in which competition results greatly depend on the judges' evaluation. In the current study, we explored the judges' performance in a five-gymnast ensemble routine. Methods: An expert-novice paradigm (10 international-level, 10 national-level, and 10 novice-level judges) was implemented under a fully simulated procedure of judgment in a five-gymnast ensemble routine of RG using two videos of routines performed by the Greek national team of RG. Simultaneous recordings of two-dimensional eye movements were taken during the judgment procedure to assess the percentage of time spent by each judge viewing the videos and fixation performance of each judge when an error in gymnast performance had occurred. Results: All judge level groups had very modest performance of error recognition on gymnasts' routines, and the best international judges reported approximately 40% of true errors. Novice judges spent significantly more time viewing the videos compared with national and international judges and spent significantly more time fixating detected errors than the other two groups. National judges were the only group that made efficient use of fixation to detect errors. Conclusions: The fact that international-level judges outperformed both other groups, while not relying on visual fixation to detect errors, suggests that these experienced judges probably make use of other cognitive strategies, increasing their overall error detection efficiency, which was, however, still far below optimum.",MEDICINE AND SCIENCE IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE,47,640,648,Web of Science,"Flessas, Konstantinos; Mylonas, Dimitris; Panagiotaropoulou, Georgia; Tsopani, Despina; Korda, Alexandrea; Siettos, Constantinos; Di Cagno, Alessandra; Evdokimidis, Ioannis; Smyrnis, Nikolaos",

This study explores the value of DSSs to clinicians, who are ultimately responsible for making diagnoses, by placing these clinicians in the role of direct system users. The central question guiding the investigation was: To what extent can consultations with diagnostic DSSs, with clinicians in training or in practice as system users, improve the quality of diagnostic hypotheses of clinicians over a set of challenging cases? At each of 3 academic medical centers and for each of 2 DSSs (ILIAD and Quick Medical Reference), 12 faculty physicians (general internists), 12 internal medicine residents, and 12 4th-yr medical students were recruited. Each of the 216 Ss was individually training on his/her assigned DSS. Each S was assigned to a case cluster and asked to generate a list of possible diagnoses, both before and after use of the DSS. The complete data set included 1934 cases generated by 215 Ss. A correct diagnosis appeared in Ss' hypothesis lists for 764 cases (39.5%) before DSS consultation and 879 cases (45.5%) after DSS consultation. Larger DSS-consultation effects were obtained for students than for faculty or residents.

An experimental test,"Although a substantial empirical literature has found associations between judges' political orientation and their judicial decisions, the nature of the relationship between policy preferences and constitutional reasoning remains unclear. In this experimental study, law students were asked to determine the constitutionality of a hypothetical law, where the policy implications of the law were manipulated while holding all legal evidence constant. The data indicate that, even with an incentive to select the ruling best supported by the legal evidence, liberal participants were more likely to overturn laws that decreased taxes than laws that increased taxes. The opposite pattern held for conservatives. The experimental manipulation significantly affected even those participants who believed their policy preferences had no influence on their constitutional decisions.

9,366,X,Expert military personal,Friend foe accuracy based on levels of stress,Gamble,2018,Different profiles of decision making and physiology under varying levels of stress in trained military personnel,"Decision making is one of the most vital processes we use every day, ranging from mundane decisions about what to eat to life-threatening choices such as how to avoid a car collision. Thus, the context in which our decisions are made is critical, and our physiology enables adaptive responses that account for how environmental stress influences our performance. The relationship between stress and decision making can additionally be affected by one's expertise in making decisions in high-threat environments, where experts can develop an adaptive response that mitigates the negative impacts of stress. In the present study, 26 male military personnel made friend/foe discriminations in an environment where we manipulated the level of stress. In the high-stress condition, participants received a shock when they incorrectly shot a friend or missed shooting a foe; in the low-stress condition, participants received a vibration for an incorrect decision. We characterized performance using signal detection theory to investigate whether a participant changed their decision criterion to avoid making an error. Results showed that under high-stress, participants made more false alarms, mistaking friends as foes, and this co-occurred with increased high frequency heart rate variability. Finally, we examined the relationship between decision making and physiology, and found that participants exhibited adaptive behavioral and physiological profiles under different stress levels. We interpret this adaptive profile as a marker of an expert's ingrained training that does not require top down control, suggesting a way that expert training in high-stress environments helps to buffer negative impacts of stress on performance.

On self–other discrepancies in medical decision making","Doctors often make decisions for their patients and predict their patients' preferences and decisions to customize advice to their particular situation. We investigated how doctors make decisions about medical treatments for their patients and themselves and how they predict their patients' decisions. We also studied whether these decisions and predictions coincide with the decisions that the patients make for themselves. We document 3 important findings. First, doctors made more conservative decisions for their patients than for themselves (i.e., they more often selected a safer medical treatment). Second, doctors did so even if they accurately predicted that their patients would want a riskier treatment than the one they selected. Doctors, therefore, showed substantial selfâ€“other discrepancies in medical decision making and did not make decisions that accurately reflected their patients' preferences. Finally, patients were not aware of these discrepancies and thought that the decisions their doctors made for themselves would be similar to the decisions they made for their patients. We explain these results in light of 2 current theories of selfâ€“other discrepancies in judgment and decision making: the risk-as-feelings hypothesis and the cognitive hypothesis. Our results have important implications for research on expert decision making and for medical practice, and shed some light on the process underlying selfâ€“other discrepancies in decision making.

(2002) and Helsen et al. (2006) considered the flash-lag effect to explain errors made by assistant referees when judging offside in association football. The main aims of the present study were as follows: (1) to determine whether the flash-lag effect emerges in offside situations on the field of play or off the field when presented as computer animations or as video footage of real-life matches; (2) to examine offside decision-making errors in two standards of assistant referee—international FIFA and Belgian national referees. The results support the flash-lag hypothesis in several ways. First, both the FIFA and Belgian assistant referees were more likely to make errors by raising their flag when they had to assess offside situations on the field of play and when presented as three-a-side computer animations. Second, more flag errors were made when the defender moved in the opposite direction to that of the attacker. Third, the strategy of raising the flag in case of doubt was not observed when an interpretation of the offside law had to be made about the involvement of play of an attacker. Future research is needed to examine the extent to which on- and off-the-field training sessions can be used as training tools to improve offside decision-making.

The first aim was to capture the specific offside decision-making skills in complex dynamic events. Second, we analyzed the type of errors to investigate the factors leading to incorrect decisions. Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA; n = 29) and Belgian elite (n = 28) assistant referees (ARs) assessed 64 computer-based offside situations. First, an expertise effect was found. The FIFA ARs assessed the trials more accurately than the Belgian ARs (76.4% vs. 67.5%). Second, regarding the type of error, all ARs clearly tended to raise their flag in doubtful situations. This observation could be explained by a perceptual bias associated with the flash-lag effect. Specifically, attackers were perceived ahead of their actual positions, and this tendency was stronger for the Belgian than for the FIFA ARs (11.0 vs. 8.4 pixels), in particular when the difficulty of the trials increased. Further experimentation is needed to examine whether video- and computer-based decision-making training is effective in improving the decision-making skills of ARs during the game.

Do these sources of bias impact legal decisions, which are frequently made by people subject to factors that have been proposed to reduce bias (training and accountability)? To answer the question, we examined the potential for 3 major social-psychological theories of gender bias (role-congruity theory, ambivalent sexism, and implicit bias) to predict outcomes of labor arbitration decisions. In the first study, undergraduate students and professional arbitrators made decisions about 2 mock arbitration cases in which the gender of the employee-grievants was experimentally manipulated. Student participants’ decisions showed the predicted gender bias, whereas the decisions of experienced professionals did not. Individual-level attitudes did not predict the extent of the observed bias and accountability did not attenuate it. In the second study, arbitrators’ explicit and implicit gender attitudes were significant predictors of their decisions in published cases. The laboratory and field results suggest that context, expertise, and implicit and explicit attitudes are relevant to legal decision-making, but that laboratory experiments alone may not fully capture the nature of their effect on legal professionals’ decisions in real cases.

They estimated their chances of meeting this goal by providing a confidence estimate. After the cases were resolved, case outcomes were compared with the predictions. Overall, lawyers were overconfident in their predictions, and calibration did not increase with years of legal experience. Female lawyers were slightly better calibrated than their male counterparts and showed evidence of less overconfidence. In an attempt to reduce overconfidence, some lawyers were asked to generate reasons why they might not achieve their stated goals. This manipulation did not improve calibration.

Serious or applied gaming is a novel educational approach to postgraduate training, combining training and assessment of clinical decision-making in a fun and challenging way. Although interest for serious games in medicine is rising, evidence on its validity is lacking. This study investigates face, content, and construct validity of this serious game. 

Experts structurally validated the game's medical content. Subsequently, 41 participants played the game. Decision scores and decision speed were compared among surgeons, surgical residents, interns, and medical students, determining the game's discriminatory ability between different levels of expertise. After playing, participants completed a questionnaire on the game's perceived realism and teaching ability. 

Surgeons solved more cases correctly (mean 77 %) than surgical residents (67 %), interns (60 %), master-degree students (50 %), and bachelor-degree students (39 % (p < 0.01). Trainees performed significantly better in their second play session than in the first (median 72 vs. 48 %, p = 0.00). Questionnaire results showed that educators and surgical trainees found the game both realistic and useful for surgical training. The majority perceived the game as fun (91.2 %), challenging (85.3 %), and would recommend the game to educate their colleagues (81.8 %). 

This serious game showed clear discriminatory ability between different levels of expertise in biliary tract disease management and clear teaching capability.

9,385,X,Officers,racial bias in trait judgments,Graham,2004,Priming unconscious racial stereotypes about adolescent offenders,"Two studies examined unconscious racial stereotypes of decision makers in the juvenile justice system. Police officers (Experiment 1) and juvenile probation officers (Experiment 2) were subliminally exposed to words related to the category Black or to words neutral with respect to race. In a presumably unrelated task, officers read 2 vignettes about a hypothetical adolescent who allegedly committed either a property crime (shoplifting from a convenience store) or an interpersonal crime (assaulting a peer). The race of the offender was left unstated and the scenarios were ambiguous about the causes of the crime. Respondents rated the hypothetical offender on a number of traits (e.g., hostility and immaturity) and made judgments about culpability, expected recidivism, and deserved punishment. They also completed a self-report measure of conscious attitudes about race. As hypothesized, officers in the racial prime condition reported more negative trait ratings, greater culpability, and expected recidivism, and they endorsed harsher punishment than did officers in the neutral condition.

,387,X,General practicioner,Accuracy of diagnosis,Groves,2003,The clinical reasoning characteristics of diagnostic experts,"The aim of this study was to identify and describe the clinical reasoning characteristics of diagnostic experts. A group of 21 experienced general practitioners were asked to complete the Diagnostic Thinking Inventory (DTI) and a set of 10 clinical reasoning problems (CRIs) to evaluate their clinical reasoning. Both the DTI and the GRPs were scored, and the CRP response patterns of each GP examined in terms of the number and type of errors contained in them. Analysis of these data showed that six GPs were able to reach the correct diagnosis using significantly less clinical information than their colleagues. These GPs also made significantly fewer interpretation errors but scored lower on both the DTI and the CRPs. Additionally, this analysis showed that more than 20% of misdiagnoses occurred despite no errors being made in the identification and interpretation of relevant clinical information. These results indicate that these six GPs diagnose efficiently, effectively and accurately using relatively few clinical data and can therefore be classified as diagnostic experts. They also indicate that a major cause of misdiagnoses is failure to properly integrate clinical data. We suggest that increased emphasis on this step in the reasoning process should prove beneficial to the development of clinical reasoning skill in undergraduate medical students.

Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated large differences in the accuracy and speed with which 104 less experienced and 7 experienced navigators made cardinal direction judgments. Reference-frame misalignment was associated with large performance decrements. The extent of these decrements diminished as ability and experience increased: however, even experienced navigators showed decrements when reference frames were misaligned. In Experiment 3, the authors used 55 college students to examine the individual subtasks of a common strategy for cardinal direction judgments and to isolate the effects of reference-frame misalignment to a particular subtask of this strategy. The tasks and strategies studied in this article can be applied in the development of navigational training and interfaces.

Fencing requires rapid and accurate decision-making while competing and experiencing gradual perceived effort. This study examined the linkage between physical effort, simple reaction time and choice reaction time in fencers and nonfencer subjects. Methods. Two age-matched groups participated in this experiment: 12 professional fencers and 12 sedentary subjects. Each subject performed both simple (SRT) and choice reaction time (CRT) tasks at rest, and while pedaling on a cycle ergometer at 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of their own maximal aerobic power (Pmax). Results. At rest, no significant differences were found between experts and sedentary subjects neither in SRT nor CRT. The fencers showed shorter CRTs at 40%, 60% and 80% of Pmax compared to those measured at rest. In contrast, SRTs did not vary as a function of effort level. In sedentary subjects, workload did not affect SRTs and CRT. Moreover, the error rate remained stable for each group over all conditions. Conclusion. Current results showed that physical load results in enhancing information processing as measured by CRT without affecting SRT. The data provides evidence that aerobic exercise enhances attentional capability in fencers who are used to process information under similar physical conditions, but not in sedentary subjects unfamiliar to this environment.

As predicted by the shifting standards model of social judgment (M. Biernat, M. Manis, &amp; T. E.

After controlling for social desirability (measured as motivation to respond without prejudice; E. A. Plant &amp; P. G.

The shift in assessment (rating the Black target more favorably than an identical White target) was more evident for participants with lower levels of color-blind attitudes.

In addition, we explored the relationship between particular choices and particular reasons, as well as the relationship of various professional characteristics to those responses. We presented 294 psychologists, randomly selected members of the Division of Psychotherapy, with ten vignettes, each representing a potential problem of professional ethics. They were asked to indicate their preferred resolution to each dilemma and their primary reason for choosing this alternative. Although practitioners were more alike than different, results showed that respondents with certain characteristics—for example, professed theoretical orientation, sex, and years of experience—did differ in their choice of response to certain ethical dilemmas. Adherence to codified ethical guidelines was also shown to be related to willingness to take direct actions to resolve ethical dilemmas.

Some researchers have suggested that superior performance by experts depends on the match between the experts' cognition and the demands of the task. The authors explored this issue using a quasi-experiment set in an organization. They examined how 3 sets of similar tasks that differ in their type of complexity can lead to differences in task perceptions and performance among experts, intermediates, and novices. The results suggest that experts and novices pay attention to different aspects of a task and that this affects both their perceptions of task complexity (i.e., task analyzability and variability) and their performance on the task.

The study draws on cognitive theory and investigates the extend to which the knowledge of these subject groups is correct with respect to incorporating intuitive judgments by various employee groups into forecasting and following strategic decision making. The authors carried out this investigation through an exploratory study of the subject groups’ confidence and accuracy (CA) performance in a constructed knowledge-based forecasting setting. The groups’ intuitive judgmental performances were examined when predicting uncertain business and industry-related outcomes. The authors surveyed 39 executives and 38 frontline employees in 12 hotels. The analysis is based on a between-participants design. The results from this setting do not fully confirm findings in earlier CA studies. Their results indicate that there are no significant differences in the accuracy of executives (as experts) and frontline employees (as novices). Although executives demonstrate overconfidence in their judgments and frontline employees demonstrate underconfidence, in line with earlier CA theory of experts and novices, the differences we find are not significant. Similarly, the CA calibration performance difference between the two groups is not significant. They suggest, among other reasons, that our findings differ from earlier CA studies because of organizational politics and culture by power distance, social capital, misuse of knowledge and the size of the business.

No investigations have been carried out in Norway into the quality of decisions made by nurses regarding our priority degree system. There are three levels: acute, urgent and non-urgent. Methods: Nurses working in seven casualty clinics in out-of-hours districts in Norway (The Watchtowers) were all invited to participate in a study to assess priority grade on 20 written medical scenarios validated by an expert group. 83 nurses (response rate 76%) participated in the study. A one-out-of-five sample of the nurses assessed the same written cases after 3 months (n=18, response rate 90%) as a test-retest assessment. Results: Among the acute, urgent and non-urgent scenarios, 82%, 74% and 81% were correctly classified according to national guidelines. There were significant differences in the proportion of correct classifications among the casualty clinics, but neither employment percentage nor profession or work experience affected the triage decision. The mean intraobserver variability measured by the Cohen kappa was 0.61 (CI 0.52 to 0.70), and there were significant differences in kappa with employment percentage. Casualty clinics and work experience did not affect intrarater agreement. Conclusion: Correct classification of acute and non-urgent cases among nurses was quite high. Work experience and employment percentage did not affect triage decision. The intrarater agreement was good and about the same as in previous studies performed in other countries.

9,401,X,Psychologists,faith bias,Harris,2016,Clinical judgment faith bias: Unexpected findings for psychology research and practice,"Professional psychologists sometimes make more pathological judgments for clients with socially deviant faith (high religiousness or spirituality) than for otherwise identical clients with socially normative faith (low religiousness or spirituality). This phenomenon is called clinical judgment faith bias, and this study used mathematical modeling to investigate whether this occurs in psychological practice. Previously, Harris (2011) surveyed a national random sample of 141 psychologists in clinical practice to investigate clinical judgment faith bias with a specially designed clinical vignette. The current study reanalyzed the data from Harris (2011), testing 2 alternative regression models with multivariate multiple regressions. The test of the first model was not significant; neither the faith magnitude of a vignette (ranging from low to high) nor its faith type (religious or spiritual) influenced the diagnostic or prognostic judgments of most psychologists. The analysis of the second model yielded significant results—but, unexpectedly, an inverse clinical judgment faith bias was found for the prognostic judgments of highly spiritual psychologists. The more spiritual (but not religious) psychologists were, the more they responded to socially deviant cases by making more positive prognostic judgments. Furthermore, a multicultural knowledge prognostic bias was found—the more multicultural knowledge (but not awareness) psychologists had, the more positive prognostic judgments they made for all cases. These findings are unexpected, contradict predictions, and must be interpreted with caution but suggest prognostic overshadowing, an entirely unanticipated bias in the clinical judgments of spiritual and multicultural psychologists.

We hypothesized that repeated simulations in the ""war games"" format would improve performance.
METHODS: Participants included medical students and residents on the trauma and surgical intensive care unit (SICU) services. Subjects were given a nursing report of an unstable patient and asked to verbalize management of the situation. Responses were transcribed and graded.
RESULTS: Eighty subjects and 5 experts participated in 227 simulations. Naive medical students, postgraduate year (PGY)-1, and PGY-2+ subjects performed worse than experts (P < .05). After participation in >= 3 war games sessions, trainees' scores were similar to experts. Subjects with the least amount of clinical experience demonstrated the most improvement.
DISCUSSION: We have designed an educational system that rapidly enhances the cognitive performance of students and residents. This may represent an important tool in assessing and enhancing the competencies of medical trainees in a safe environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

,405,X,Arbitrators,Cognitive illusions,Helm,2016,Are Arbitrators Human?,"Empirical research has confirmed the correctness of the legal realists’ assertion that “judges are human.” It demonstrates that judicial decisions are sometimes tainted by bias, ideology, or error. Presumably, arbitrators are “human” in that sense too, but that conclusion does not necessarily follow. Although arbitrators and judges both umpire disputes, they differ in a variety of ways. Therefore, it is possible that arbitrators’ awards are either better or worse than judges’ decisions. This article reports the results of research conducted on elite arbitrators specializing in resolving commercial disputes. Our goal was to determine whether, like judges, arbitrators are subject to three common cognitive illusions—specifically, the conjunction fallacy, the framing effect, and the confirmation bias. We also wanted to find out whether, like judges, arbitrators exhibit a tendency to rely excessively on intuition that may exacerbate the impact of cognitive illusions on their decision making. Our results reveal that “arbitrators are human,” and indicate that arbitrators perform about the same as judges in experiments designed to detect the presence of common cognitive errors and excessive reliance on intuition. This suggests that arbitrators lack an inherent advantage over judges when it comes to making high‐quality decisions. Whether the situation in which arbitrators make their awards is more conducive to sound decision making than the setting in which judges make their rulings, however, remains unclear",JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL LEGAL STUDIES,13,666,692,Web of Science,"Helm, Rebecca K.; Wistrich, Andrew J.; Rachlinski, Jeffrey J.",

Mean proficiency scores were 51 % for atrial flutter and 35 % for ventricular tachycardia. Thirteen percent of the atrial flutter and 35 % of the ventricular tachycardia simulations ended in patient death. Failure to recognize ventricular tachycardia and unfamiliarity with second- and third-line treatments were major sources oferror.

Experiments 1 and 2 examined the responses of actual judges in a 2 (high versus low benefit) × 2 (search procedure conducted respectfully versus disrespectfully) randomized factorial. In both studies judges evaluated procedures differently than is typical among samples of decision recipients: outcome concerns strongly influenced both procedural evaluations and procedural fairness while procedural concerns such as voice and respect were minimally influential. Whereas fairness concerns continued to be important among these decision makers, outcome fairness was more influential than procedural fairness. Studies 3 and 4 varied role (authority versus subordinate), procedural respect, and societal benefits.

Judgment accuracy was higher (a) on classroom tests and (b) for students without disabilities. Among less accurate judgments, teachers consistently underestimated the performances of students with disabilities. Students with disabilities performed lower on both types of tests. Student test performance accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in teacher judgment accuracy. Implications of these findings for future research and practice are discussed.

Method: The study was a randomized controlled trial using case vignette methodology. Participants were 137 mental health professionals working in different regions of the United States (M = 8.6 ± 7.5 years of experience). Participants were randomly assigned to a (a) brief overview of PBD (control condition), or (b) the same brief overview plus a cognitive debiasing intervention (treatment condition) that educated participants about common cognitive pitfalls (e.g., base-rate neglect, search satisficing) and taught corrective strategies (e.g., mnemonics, Bayesian tools). Both groups evaluated 4 identical case vignettes. Primary outcome measures were clinicians’ diagnoses and treatment decisions. The vignette characters’ race or ethnicity was experimentally manipulated. Results: Participants in the treatment group showed better overall judgment accuracy, p &lt; .001, and committed significantly fewer decision-making errors, p &lt; .001. Inaccurate and somewhat accurate diagnostic decisions were significantly associated with different treatment and clinical recommendations, particularly in cases where participants missed comorbid conditions, failed to detect the possibility of hypomania or mania in depressed youths, and misdiagnosed classic manic symptoms. In contrast, effects of patient race were negligible. Conclusions: The cognitive debiasing intervention outperformed the control condition. Examining specific heuristics in cases of PBD may identify especially problematic mismatches between typical habits of thought and characteristics of the disorder. The debiasing intervention was brief and delivered via the Web; it has the potential to generalize and extend to other diagnoses as well as to various practice and training settings.

Opponents of direct access to physical therapy argue that physical therapists may overlook serious medical conditions. More information is needed to determine the ability of physical therapists to practice safely in direct-access environments. The purpose of this study was to describe the ability of physical therapists to make decisions about the management of patients in a direct-access environment. Subjects. Of a random sample of 1,000 members of the Private Practice Section of the American Physical Therapy Association, 394 participated. Methods. A survey included 12 hypothetical case scenarios. For each case, participants determined whether they would provide intervention without referral, provide intervention and refer, or refer before intervention. The percentage of correct decisions for each group of scenarios was calculated for each participant, and participants were classified as having made correct decisions for 100% of cases or less for each group. Three sets of logistic regressions were completed to determine the characteristics of the participants in relation to the decision category. Results. The average percentages of correct decisions were 87%, 88%, and 79% for musculoskeletal, noncritical medical, and critical medical conditions, respectively. Of all participants, approximately 50% made correct decisions for all cases within each group. The odds of making 100% correct decisions if a physical therapist had an orthopedic specialization were 2.23 (95% confidence interval=1.35-3.71) for musculoskeletal conditions and 1.89 (95% confidence interval = 1.14-3.15) for critical medical conditions.

9,424,X,Doctors,Managing adverse treatment effects,Jiwa,2014,The management of acute adverse effects of breast cancer treatment in general practice: A video-vignette study,"Background: There has been a focus recently on the use of the Internet and email to deliver education interventions to general practitioners (GPs). The treatment of breast cancer may include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormone treatment. These treatments may have acute adverse effects. GPs need more information on the diagnosis and management of specific adverse effects encountered immediately after cancer treatment. Objective: The goal was to evaluate an Internet-based educational program developed for GPs to advise patients with acute adverse effects following breast cancer treatment. Methods: During phase 1, participants viewed 6 video vignettes of actor-patients reporting 1 of 6 acute symptoms following surgery and chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment. GPs indicated their diagnosis and proposed management through an online survey program. They received feedback about each scenario in the form of a specialist clinic letter, as if the patient had been seen at a specialist clinic after they had attended the GP. This letter incorporated extracts from local guidelines on the management of the symptoms presented. This feedback was sent to the GPs electronically on the same survey platform. In phase 2, all GPs were invited to manage similar cases as phase 1. Their proposed management was compared to the guidelines. McNemar test was used to compare data from phases 1 and 2, and logistic regression was used to explore the GP characteristics that were associated with inappropriate case management. Results: A total of 50 GPs participated. Participants were younger and more likely to be female than other GPs in Australia. For 5 of 6 vignettes in phase 1, management was consistent with expert opinion in the minority of cases (6%-46%). Participant demographic characteristics had a variable effect on different management decisions in phase 1. The variables modeled explained 15%-28% of the differences observed. Diagnosis and management improved significantly in phase 2, especially for diarrhea, neutropenia, and seroma sample cases. The proportion of incorrect management responses was reduced to a minimum (25.3%-49.3%) in phase 2. Conclusions: There was evidence that providing feedback by experts on specific cases had an impact on GPs’ knowledge about how to appropriately manage acute treatment adverse effects. This educational intervention could be targeted to support the implementation of shared care during cancer treatment.

9,426,X,Experts vs novices,diagnosis accuracy,Johnson,1995,Quantifying the measurement of differential diagnosis.,"Differential diagnosis is central to the work and training of all health care professionals. To develop solid differential diagnosis and skills, students required practice diagnosing numerous and varied patients. In the absence of real patients, patient simulations are commonly used to provide this range of diagnostic experiences. This study examined the benefits of interactive patient simulations on the diagnostic approaches of beginning dental students (novices) and practicing dentists (experts). The study tested the hypothesis that novices tend to use trial-and-error, while experts tend to use pattern recognition during differential diagnosis. a second goal of the study explored objective and subjective measures of a differential diagnosis approach. Seventy-five subjects comprised two treatment groups: a novice group and an expert group. Each group completed ten patient simulations and a case study test measured the diagnostic approach. A three factor MANOVA (p>0.05) was followed by univariate ANOVA's. The result indicated differences between the diagnostic approaches of experts and novices and that the subjective Ratings and the objective Maximum Decisions and Average Variation variables were the best measures of a differential diagnostic approach.",Medinfo.

One group of Ss estimated the frequency of hits, walks, strikeouts, putouts, and ""all other"" outcomes for an average major league player in 100 times at bat. Another group estimated these event outcome frequencies in a short-list condition (S-LC; e.g., strikeouts, walks, and ""all other""). Strong list-length effects (L-LEs) were observed with novices; the frequency estimate for strikeouts, for example, was nearly twice as high in the S-LC as in the long-list condition. Experts, however, showed no L-LE, and their estimated probabilities were very near actual (normatively correct) probabilities in all conditions. It is argued that the omission effect can be overridden by strong mental representations of the family of possible events and/or clear knowledge of probabilities associated with events. L-LEs seem to result at least in part from an anchoring-and-adjustment strategy.

Commonly, the correctness of a diagnosis is determined by the judgment of one or more experts. In this study, the consistency of experts' judgments of the correctness of a diagnosis, and the structure of knowledge supporting their judgments, were explored using a card sorting task. Seven expert pediatricians were asked to sort into piles the diagnoses proposed by 119 individuals who had worked through a simulated patient case of Haemophilus influenzae Type B (HIB) meningitis. The 119 individuals had varying experience levels. The expert pediatricians were asked to sort the proposed diagnoses by similarity of content, and then to order the piles based on correctness, relative to the known correct diagnosis (HIB meningitis). Finally, the experts were asked to judge which piles contained correct or incorrect diagnoses. We found that, contrary to previous studies, experts shared a common conceptual framework of the diagnostic domain being considered and were consistent in how they categorized the diagnoses. However, similar to previous studies, the experts differed greatly in their judgment of which diagnoses were correct. This study has important implications for understanding expert knowledge, for scoring performance on simulated or real patient cases, for providing feedback to learners in the clinical setting, and for establishing criteria that define what is correct in studies of diagnostic error and diagnostic reasoning.",ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,15,65,79,Web of Science,"Kanter, Steven L.; Brosenitsch, Teresa A.; Mahoney, John F.; Staszewski, James",

There are only few studies of helpline counselors, and little is known about their ability to accurately determine the level of risk for SRB. Aims: To examine whether helpline counselors can agree on judgments of risk for SRB, and whether their judgments are consistent with youths’ actual behavior in a 6-month period following intake. Methods: 34 helpline counselors, recruited from three helplines, were studied. Information was collected on their judgments of risk for SRB for each of 45 youths over a 6-month period following initial intake. Results: Contrary to expectations, the counselors had a high rate of agreement ( k = .56), and their risk judgments could be used quite successfully (80.0% correct classification) in identifying youths who later engaged in SRB. Conclusions: Unlike most other groups represented in the decision-making literature, helpline counselors agree and are accurate in their judgments of risk for SRB. Our findings suggest that it might be beneficial to apply some of the procedures used to train helpline clinicians to other types of clinicians. Further studies of helpline clinicians are suggested.

This study addressed how to teach students to minimize inappropriate polypharmacy. Final-year medical students (N = 106) from two Dutch schools of medicine participated in this randomized controlled trial with a pre/posttest design. The Systematic Tool to Reduce Inappropriate Prescribing (STRIP) was used as the intervention. This medication review tool consists of five steps and is part of the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline on polypharmacy. Step two is a structured pharmaceutical analysis of drug use, assessed using six questions regarding undertreatment, ineffective treatment, overtreatment, potential adverse effects, contraindications or interactions, and dose adjustments. It is used in combination with the Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment and the Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions checklists. Students were asked to optimize the medication lists of real people, making use, or not, of the STRIP. The number of correct or potentially harmful decisions that the students made when revising the lists was determined by comparison with expert consensus. Students who used the STRIP had better scores than control students; they made more correct decisions (9.3 vs 7.0, 34%; P < .001, correlation coefficient (r) = 0.365) and fewer potentially harmful decisions (3.9 vs 5.6, -30%; P < .001, r = 0.386). E-learning did not have a different effect from that of non-E-learning methods. Students were satisfied with the method.

,437,X,scientists,accuracy judgement,Kelemen,2013,Professional physical scientists display tenacious teleological tendencies: Purpose-based reasoning as a cognitive default,"Teleological explanations account for objects and events by reference to a functional consequence or purpose. Although they are popular in religion, they are unpopular in science: Physical scientists in particular explicitly reject them when explaining natural phenomena. However, prior research provides reasons to suspect that this explanatory form may represent a default explanatory preference. As a strong test of this hypothesis, we explored whether physical scientists endorse teleological explanations of natural phenomena when their information-processing resources are limited. In Study 1, physical scientists from top-ranked American universities judged explanations as true or false, either at speed or without time restriction. Like undergraduates and age-matched community participants, scientists demonstrated increased acceptance of unwarranted teleological explanations under speed despite maintaining high accuracy on control items. Scientists’ overall endorsement of inaccurate teleological explanation was lower than comparison groups, however. In Study 2, we explored this further and found that the teleological tendencies of professional scientists did not differ from those of humanities scholars. Thus, although extended education appears to produce an overall reduction in inaccurate teleological explanation, specialization as a scientist does not, in itself, additionally ameliorate scientifically inaccurate purpose-based theories about the natural world. A religion-consistent default cognitive bias toward teleological explanation tenaciously persists and may have subtle but profound consequences for scientific progress.

The aim of the current study was to assess if a video-based decision-making test could discriminate different age-matched skill levels of talent in Australian soccer.

Results An ANOVA test showed that the video-based test significantly discriminated between all three groups, with the national elite athletes selecting more correct responses than the state elite (65.3 +/- 8.1%; 56.0 +/- 9.1%, respectively). The state elite were more accurate than the sub-elite (45.9 +/- 8.8%). Conclusions 
Results suggest that a video-based test may be a suitable tool to use in the selection of athletes as a measure of decision-making skill.

How do practicing clinical psychologists use the context of life events to judge the abnormality of a person's current behaviors? The appropriate role of life-event context in assessment has long been the subject of intense debate and scrutiny among clinical theorists, yet relatively little is known about clinicians' own judgments in practice. The authors propose a proportionate-response hypothesis, such that judgments of abnormality are influenced by whether the behaviors are a disproportionate response to past events, rendering them difficult to understand or explain. Licensed, practicing clinical psychologists (N = 77) were presented with vignettes describing hypothetical people's behaviors (disordered, mildly distressed, or unaffected) that had been preceded by either traumatic or mildly distressing events. Experts' judgments of abnormality were strongly and systematically influenced by the degree of mismatch between the past event and current behaviors in strength and valence, such that the greater the mismatch, the more abnormal the person seemed. A separate, additional group of clinical psychologists (N = 20) further confirmed that the greater the degree of mismatch, the greater the perceived difficulty in understanding the patient. These findings held true across clinicians of different theoretical orientations and in disorders for which these patterns of judgments ran contrary to formal recommendations in the DSM–IV–TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). The rationality of these effects and implications for clinical decision science are discussed.

9,443,X,Primary care physicians,Bias in reference to international specialist,Kinchen,2004,The impact of international medical graduate status on primary care physicians' choice of specialist,"Background: Approximately one fourth of practicing physicians in the United States graduated from medical schools in other countries. It is unknown how the role of international medical graduate status affects physician decision-making. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether a primary care physicians' knowledge of a specialist's international medical graduate status affects his or her decision to refer patients to that specialist. Research Design and Subjects: We studied a national, cross-sectional study of primary care physicians who see adult patients. The sample was drawn from the American Medical Association Physician's Professional Data. Each physician received 2 clinical case vignettes describing a patient for whom referral to a specialist was considered necessary. Each vignette was followed by 5 vignette specialist descriptions with medical school graduate status varied randomly alongside other physician characteristics. Measure: We measured the decision to refer to an international versus U.S. medical graduate specialist. Results: Of 1054 eligible physicians, 623 (59.1%) responded. Respondents were significantly more likely to refer to a U.S. medical graduate (USMG) compared with an international medical graduate (IMG) (63% vs. 54%, P <0.05). After adjustment for age, race, sex, and referral characteristics of the vignette specialists, a positive referral decision was noted in a higher proportion of vignettes in which the vignette specialist was described as a USMG versus an IMG (63% vs. 51%, P <0.05). Conclusion: With other factors being equal, vignette specialists described as IMGs versus USMGs were significantly less likely to be associated with a positive referral decision. Although specialist IMG status, relative to other factors, might not have a major effect on referral decisions, it is possible that negative views of international medical graduates could lead to suboptimal choices in referral decisions. Potentially, a patient could be referred to an USMG who happens to have inferior clinical skills than an IMG with superior clinical skills.",MEDICAL CARE,42,747,755,Web of Science,"Kinchen, KS; Cooper, LA; Wang, NY; Levine, D; Powe, NR",

As demonstrated by the Knobe effect, a knowingly incurred negative side effect is standardly judged intentional, whereas a positive side effect is not. We report the first empirical investigation into intentionality ascriptions made by professional judges, which finds (i) that professionals are sensitive to the moral valence of outcome type, and (ii) that the worse the outcome, the higher the propensity to ascribe intentionality.

,451,X,,hindisght bias,Knoll,2017,The effects of expertise on the hindsight bias,"We present data from three experiments examining the effects of objective and subjective expertise on the hindsight bias. In Experiment 1, participants read an essay about baseball or dogs and then answered questions about the baseball essay to the best of their ability, as if they had not read the essay, or to the best of their ability, although they read about dogs. Participants also completed a quiz about baseball rules and terminology, which was an objective measure of expertise. Results demonstrated that as participants' baseball expertise increased, their inability to act as if they never read the essay also increased; expertise exacerbated the hindsight bias. To test the effects of subjective expertise on hindsight bias and investigate factors underlying the relationship, participants in Experiment 2 ranked five topics in order of expertise and gave feeling‐of‐knowing (FOK) ratings for questions from these topics. Foresight participants then saw each question again and answered the questions; hindsight participants saw the questions and answers and gave the probability they would have known the answers had they not been provided. Hindsight bias increased with subjective expertise as did average FOK ratings. In Experiment 3, we experimentally manipulated perceived expertise but found that neither average FOK ratings nor hindsight bias was affected by experimentally induced expertise. Taken together, the results demonstrate that expertise exacerbates both objective and subjective hindsight bias but that an FOK, which likely exists only when expertise is naturally acquired, is necessary to engender the detrimental effect of expertise on the hindsight bias.

Training interacted with the internal validity manipulation. Scientifically trained judges rated valid evidence more positively than did untrained judges. Untrained judges rated a study with a confound more positively than did trained judges. Training did not affect judge evaluations of studies with a missing control group or potential experimenter bias.

Specifically, we assessed effects using the following: (1) a quality tool to aid in the assessment of the clarity of the friction ridge details, (2) a statistical tool to provide likelihood ratios representing the strength of the corresponding features between compared fingerprints, and (3) consensus information from a group of trained fingerprint experts. The measured variables for the effect on examiner performance were the accuracy and reproducibility of the conclusions against the ground truth (including the impact on error rates) and the analyst accuracy and variation for feature selection and comparison. The results showed that participants using the consensus information from other fingerprint experts demonstrated more consistency and accuracy in minutiae selection. They also demonstrated higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the decisions reported. The quality tool also affected minutiae selection (which, in turn, had limited influence on the reported decisions); the statistical tool did not appear to influence the reported decisions.",FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL,219,,,Web of Science,"Langenburg, Glenn; Champod, Christophe; Genessay, Thibault",
,462,X,competition judges,judgements of competitors,Larson,2017,Adaptation and fallibility in experts’ judgments of novice performers,"Competition judges are often selected for their expertise, under the belief that a high level of performance expertise should enable accurate judgments of the competitors. Contrary to this assumption, we find evidence that expertise can reduce judgment accuracy. Adaptation level theory proposes that discriminatory capacity decreases with greater distance from one’s adaptation level. Because experts’ learning has produced an adaptation level close to ideal performance standards, they may be less able to discriminate among lower-level competitors. As a result, expertise increases judgment accuracy of high-level competitions but decreases judgment accuracy of low-level competitions. Additionally, we demonstrate that, consistent with an adaptation level theory account of expert judgment, experts systematically give more critical ratings than intermediates or novices. In summary, this work demonstrates a systematic change in human perception that occurs as task learning increases.

,471,X,Expert groups vs non-experts,Time spent studying radiograph,Leong,2007,Visual search behaviour in skeletal radiographs: a cross-speciality study,"Aim: To determine whether experience improves the consistency of visual search behaviour in fracture identification in plain radiographs, and the effect of specialization.
Material and methods: Twenty-five observers consisting of consultant radiologists, consultant orthopaedic surgeons, orthopaedic specialist registrars, orthopaedic senior house officers, and accident and emergency senior house officers examined 33 skeletal radiographs (shoulder, hand, and knee). Eye movement data were collected using a Tobii 1750 eye tracker with levels of diagnostic confidence collected simultaneously. Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Gaussian mixture model fitting of fixation distance-to-fracture were used to calculate the consistency and the relationship between discovery and reflective visual search phases among different observer groups.
Results: Total time spent studying the radiograph was not significantly different between the groups. However, the expert groups had a higher number of true positives (p<0.001) with less dwell time on the fracture site (p < 0.001) and smaller KL distance (r = 0.062, p < 0.001) between trials. The Gaussian mixture model revealed smaller mean squared error in the expert groups in hand radiographs (r = 0. 162, p = 0.07); however, the reverse was true in shoulder radiographs (r = -0.287, p < 0.001). The relative duration of the reflective phase decreases as the confidence level increased (r = 0.266, p = 0.074).
Conclusions: Expert search behaviour exhibited higher accuracy and consistency whilst using less time fixating on fracture sites. This strategy conforms to the discovery and reflective phases of the global-focal model, where the reflective search may be implicated in the cross-referencing and conspicuity of the target, as well as the level of decision-making process involved. The effect of specialization appears to change the search strategy more than the effect of the length of training. (C) 2007 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The study also tests two strategies to reduce confirmation bias: (1) decoupling decision to apprehend from interrogation and (2) reducing cognitive load for the interrogating police officer. In Experiment 1, Swedish police officers ( N = 60) were faced with 12 scenarios in which they either had to decide for themselves whether to apprehend a suspect or were informed about the corresponding decision by another police officer or a prosecutor. Participants then prepared questions for a suspect interrogation and evaluated the trustworthiness of the suspect’s denial or confession. The same method was used in Experiment 2 but with law and psychology students ( N = 60) as participants. In Experiment 3, psychology students ( N = 60) prepared interrogation questions either by freely producing their own or by choosing questions from a preset list. Overall, apprehended suspects were interrogated in a more guilt presumptive way and rated as less trustworthy than non apprehended suspects. However, the tested debiasing techniques, primarily reducing cognitive load for the interrogating police officer, hold some potential in mitigating this bias.

Materials and Methods: This study was a web-based perception experiment. 

A total of 12 board-certified radiologists were asked to interpret 40 adult chest images (20 abnormal) twice and decide if pulmonary lesions were present. Before the first viewing, a general clinical history was given for all images: cough for 3+ weeks. This was called the ""defendants read."" 

Two weeks later, the radiologists were asked to view the same dataset (unaware that the dataset was unchanged). For this reading, the radiologists were given the following information for all images: ""These images were reported normal but all of these patients have a lung tumour diagnosed on a subsequent radiograph 6 months later."" They were also given the lobar location of the newly diagnosed tumor. This was called the ""expert witness read."" 

Results: There was a significant difference in location-based sensitivity ON = -45, P = 0.02) between the two conditions with nodule detection increasing under the second condition. Specificity increased outside the lobe of interest ON = 727, P = < 0.0001) and decreased within the lobe of interest ON = -237, P = 0.03) significantly in the ""expert witness"" read.

,480,X,Controllers,Intervene decision,Loft,2009,A theory and model of conflict detection in air traffic control: Incorporating environmental constraints,"A performance theory for conflict detection in air traffic control is presented that specifies how controllers adapt decisions to compensate for environmental constraints. This theory is then used as a framework for a model that can fit controller intervention decisions. The performance theory proposes that controllers apply safety margins to ensure separation between aircraft. These safety margins are formed through experience and reflect the biasing of decisions to favor safety over accuracy, as well as expectations regarding uncertainty in aircraft trajectory. In 2 experiments, controllers indicated whether they would intervene to ensure separation between pairs of aircraft. The model closely predicted the probability of controller intervention across the geometry of problems and as a function of controller experience. When controller safety margins were manipulated via task instructions, the parameters of the model changed in the predicted direction. The strength of the model over existing and alternative models is that it better captures the uncertainty and decision biases involved in the process of conflict detection.

In Study 1, semistructured interviews revealed 10 schemata shared by a high proportion of 40 POs that included information about criminal behavior, social histories, attributions, treatment and supervisory strategies, and prognoses. Experienced POs produced fewer but richer (more detailed) schemata than inexperienced POs. In Study 2, 20 POs and 20 clerical staff sorted items of information into case descriptions to validate the schemata. POs consistently reproduced schemata, but laypeople did not. Among POs, schema detail depended on experience with instances of the case type. Study 3, with additional groups of 20 POs and 20 clerical staff, showed that schematic knowledge affects probation decisions. Cases fitting a schema were evaluated more consistently and distinctively, and judgments were made more quickly, easily, and confidently than for mixed schematic or real cases. These differences existed for experienced POs but not for clerical staff, who lacked schematic knowledge. Theoretical and practical issues of schematic processing, expertise, and decision aids are discussed.

9,486,X,Clinical residents,Accuracy of diagnosis,Mamede,2008,Effects of reflective practice on the accuracy of medical diagnoses,"CONTEXT Reflective practice has been suggested to be an important instrument in improving clinical judgement and developing medical expertise. Empirical evidence supporting this suggestion, however, is absent. This paper reports on an experiment conducted to study the effects of reflective practice on diagnostic accuracy.
METHODS Participants were 42 internal medicine residents in hospitals in 2 states in the northeast of Brazil. They diagnosed 16 clinical cases. The experiment employed a repeated measures design, with 2 independent variables: the complexity of clinical cases (simple or complex), and the reasoning approach induced to diagnose the case (participants were instructed to diagnose each case either through pattern recognition or reflective reasoning). The dependent variable was the accuracy of the diagnosis provided for each case. All participants participated in each of the 2 levels of both independent variables.
RESULTS A main effect of case complexity emerged. There was no statistically significant main effect of reflective practice. However, a significant interaction effect was found between case complexity and mode of processing (F[1,41] = 4.48, P < 0.05), indicating that although reflective practice did not make a difference to accuracy of diagnosis in simple cases, it had a positive effect when diagnosing complex cases.
CONCLUSIONS Reflective practice had a positive effect on diagnosis of complex, unusual cases. Non-analytical reasoning was shown to be as effective as reflective reasoning for diagnosing routine clinical cases. Findings support the idea that reflective practice may particularly improve diagnoses in situations of uncertainty and uniqueness, reducing diagnostic errors.

Observation of the aerial perspective resulted in superior decision-making performance, most likely a reflection of the additional specifying information available from this viewpoint. Visual search recordings demonstrated increased time spent observing open space in the aerial perspective, along with more fixations of lesser duration primarily due to an increase in the referential fixation transitions between the player in possession of the ball and other attacking features.

Accuracy rates were higher than those typically found in deception research and reached levels similar to those obtained by specialized lie detectors in previous research. Accuracy was positively correlated with perceived experience in interviewing suspects and with mentioning cues to detecting deceit that relate to a suspect's story. Accuracy was negatively correlated with popular stereotypical cues such as gaze aversion and fidgeting. As in previous research, accuracy and confidence were not significantly correlated, but the level of confidence was dependent on whether officers judged actual truths or actual lies and on the method by which confidence was measured.

Methods: Five sets of radiographs were converted to slides and projected on a screen under standardized conditions. 143 students were asked to determine separately the presence of all proximal caries, of proximal lesions to be restored in the present course of treatment, and of unreadable surfaces due to technical deficiencies. A gold standard was obtained from two expert clinicians who examined the radiographs under similar conditions.
Results: Misdiagnoses were common. Overdiagnoses became evident at the treatment planning stage where many surfaces were incorrectly planned for restoration. Subjective appraisals of presence of lesions, unreadable surfaces, and surfaces planned for restoration showed substantial variation.
Conclusions: Students' overall assessment of lesions detected did not differ between restored and unrestored surfaces. However, when compared with the gold standard, their decisionmaking was found to be better on surfaces which had not been restored previously as opposed to those already restored, both in terms of identification of lesions and in terms of treatment planned for deeper lesions.",DENTOMAXILLOFACIAL RADIOLOGY,26,107,111,Web of Science,"Maupome, G; Sheiham, A",

Experiment 1 examined interval estimates from information technology (IT) professionals and UCS an Diego (UCSD) students about both the IT industry and UCSD. This within-subjects experiment showed that experts and novices were about equally overconfident. Experts reported intervals that had midpoints closer to the true value--which increased hit rate--and that were narrower (i.e., more informative)--which decreased hit rate. The net effect was no change in hit rate and overconfidence. Experiment 2 showed that both experts and novices mistakenly expected experts to be much less overconfident than novices, but they correctly predicted that experts would provide narrower intervals with midpoints closer to the truth.

9,497,X,Medical residents,Retaining correct/incorrect diagnosis,McLaughlin,2008,Initial diagnostic hypotheses bias analytic information processing in non-visual domains,"CONTEXT Previous studies have shown that an initial diagnostic hypothesis biases automatic information processing. It is unclear if an initial hypothesis has a similar effect on analytic information processing. Our first objective was to study the effect of an initial diagnostic hypothesis on analytic processing. Our second objective was to assess the effect of clinical experience on analytic processing by evaluating the effect of clinical frequency and urgency of an alternative diagnosis on diagnosis selection.
METHODS During a 12-minute objective structured clinical examination station, 19 subspecialty medical residents diagnosed the cause of 3 clinical presentations: dyspnoea; headache, and chest pain. Subjects were randomly allocated cases for which the suggested initial hypothesis was either correct or incorrect. For cases with an incorrect initial hypothesis, the alternative diagnoses varied in the frequency with which they are encountered in clinical practice, and their clinical urgency, relative to the initial diagnostic hypothesis.
RESULTS All correct initial hypotheses were retained, compared with 10.9% of incorrect hypotheses. All cases with a correct initial hypothesis were diagnosed correctly, compared with 65.2% of cases with an incorrect hypothesis (risk ratio 1.5 [95% confidence interval 1.2-1.9], P = 0.02). Clinical frequency and urgency were not associated with alternative diagnosis selection.
DISCUSSION Our results suggest that an initial diagnostic hypothesis biases analytic processing. The data used to reject an initial hypothesis appear to drive selection of an alternative hypothesis. Further studies aimed at finding strategies for increasing the likelihood of generating a correct initial hypothesis or debiasing an initial hypothesis are needed.

At the time of entry to the hospital, 78 physicians estimated the probability that each of 317 patients (mean age 42.2 yrs) would physically attack other people during the first week of psychiatric hospitalization. The clinicians also indicated the degree of confidence they had in their estimates of violence potential. Nurses rated the occurrence of inpatient physical assaults with the Overt Aggression Scale. The results showed that when clinicians had a high degree of confidence, their evaluations of risk of violence were strongly associated with whether or not patients became violent. At moderate levels of confidence, clinicians' risk estimates had a lower, but still substantial relationship with the later occurrence of violence. However, when clinicians had low confidence, their assessments of potential for violence had little relationship to whether or not the patients became violent. The findings suggest that the level of confidence that clinicians have in their evaluations is an important moderator of the predictive validity of their assessments of patients' potential for violence.

OBJECTIVE: To determine how pathology residents learn to diagnose inflammatory skin dermatoses, we contrasted the slide exploration strategy, perceptual capture of relevant histopathologic findings, and cognitive integration of identified features between 2 groups of residents, those who had and those who had not undergone their dermatopathology rotation.DESIGN: Residents read a case set of 20 virtual slides (10 depicting nodular and diffuse dermatitis and 10 depicting subepidermal vesicular dermatitis), using an in-house-developed interface. We recorded residents' reports of diagnostic findings, conjectured diagnostic hypotheses, and final (or differential) diagnosis for each case, and time stamped each interaction with the interface. We created search maps of residents' slide exploration strategy. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the resident groups in the number of correctly or incorrectly reported diagnostic findings, but residents with dermatopathology training generated significantly more correct hypotheses (mean improvement of 88.5%) and correct diagnoses (70% of all correct diagnoses). CONCLUSIONS: Two types of slide exploration strategy were identified for both groups: (1) a focused and efficient search, observed when the final diagnosis was correct; and (2) a more dispersed, time-consuming strategy, observed when the final diagnosis was incorrect. This difference was statistically significant, and it suggests that initial interpretation of a slide may bias further slide exploration.",ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE,136,551,562,Web of Science,"Mello-Thoms, Claudia; Mello, Carlos A.

,500,X,Doctors and medical students,Confirmation bias,Mendel,2011,Confirmation bias: Why psychiatrists stick to wrong preliminary diagnoses,"Background: Diagnostic errors can have tremendous consequences because they can result in a fatal chain of wrong decisions. Experts assume that physicians' desire to confirm a preliminary diagnosis while failing to seek contradictory evidence is an important reason for wrong diagnoses. This tendency is called 'confirmation bias'. Method: To study whether psychiatrists and medical students are prone to confirmation bias and whether confirmation bias leads to poor diagnostic accuracy in psychiatry, we presented an experimental decision task to 75 psychiatrists and 75 medical students. Results: A total of 13% of psychiatrists and 25% of students showed confirmation bias when searching for new information after having made a preliminary diagnosis. Participants conducting a confirmatory information search were significantly less likely to make the correct diagnosis compared to participants searching in a disconfirmatory or balanced way [multiple logistic regression: odds ratio (OR) 7.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.53-21.22, p&lt;0.001; OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.23-8.56, p=0.02]. Psychiatrists conducting a confirmatory search made a wrong diagnosis in 70% of the cases compared to 27% or 47% for a disconfirmatory or balanced information search (students: 63, 26 and 27%). Participants choosing the wrong diagnosis also prescribed different treatment options compared with participants choosing the correct diagnosis. Conclusions: Confirmatory information search harbors the risk of wrong diagnostic decisions. Psychiatrists should be aware of confirmation bias and instructed in techniques to reduce bias.

Hendricks (1997) decision, in which the Supreme Court authorized post-sentence civil commitment for certain sex offenders, appeared to be constitutionally legitimized by limiting the class of offenders eligible for this special form of civil commitment to those who are ""unable to control"" their dangerousness. Nowhere in the available record, however, did the Court elucidate what they meant by this notion of volitional impairment. This study sought to examine factors that legal professionals (a = 43), psychologists (n = 40), and mock jurors (n = 76) deem most relevant to a determination of sex offender volitional impairment. Participants, who were randomly assigned to a sexual predator commitment or an insanity hearing context, read a series of 16 vignettes that described a pedophilic offender and included combinations of variables hypothesized to be related to judgments of volitional impairment. Results suggested that participants, who as a group made remarkably high estimates of likelihood of future sexual violence, considered verbalization of control, history of sexual violence, and the context of the hearing as highly relevant to determinations of volitional impairment.

Counselors then rated the woman's psychological functioning and their own anticipated reactions to having the woman as a client. As the authors hypothesized, counselors with the most negative attitudes regarding bisexuality were more likely than others to have negative reactions to the client, anticipate responding to the client in a biased and judgmental manner, believe the client had problems in areas related to bisexual stereotypes, and rate the client as having a low level of psychosocial functioning. Attitudes regarding bisexuality were significantly related to counselors' clinical judgments and reactions even after controlling for attitudes toward lesbians and gay men.

Pilots and nonpilots listened to ATC messages that described a route through an airspace, while they referred to a chart of the airspace. They read back (repeated) each message and then answered a probe question about the route. In a preliminary study, participants could take notes while listening to the messages and performing the read-back and probe tasks. In Experiment 1, opportunity to take notes was manipulated. Note taking determined when expertise mitigated age differences on the read-back task. With note taking, read-back accuracy declined with age for nonpilots but not for pilots. Without note taking, similar age-related declines occurred for pilots and nonpilots. Benefits of expertise, younger age, and note taking occurred for probe accuracy, but mitigation did not occur. The findings suggest that older adults take advantage of a domain-relevant form of environmental support (note taking) to maintain performance on some complex tasks despite typical age-related declines in cognitive ability.

Young, middle-aged, and older pilots and nonpilots listened to ATC messages that described a route through an airspace, during which they referred to a chart of this airspace. Participants read back each message and then answered a probe question about the route. It was found that pilots read back messages more accurately than nonpilots, and younger participants were more accurate than older participants. Age differences were not reduced for pilots. Pilots and younger participants also answered probes more accurately, suggesting that they were better able to interpret the ATC messages in terms of the chart in order to create a situation model of the flight. The findings suggest that expertise benefits occur for adults of all ages. High levels of flying experience among older pilots (as compared with younger pilots) helped to buffer age-related declines in cognitive resources, thus providing evidence for the mediating effects of experience on age differences.

Eighty-eight teachers with experience ranging from 1-5 years completed a series of open and forced-choice questions that required the rater to hypothesize the possible maintaining function of the student's behavior (e.g., attention or escape). Results indicated that, in general, teachers' across all levels taught struggled to accurately hypothesize the function of behavior. Novice special education teachers were more accurate on forced-choice questions and general education teachers evidenced greater accuracy on open-ended questions. Across all teachers, elementary and special educators yielded higher scores across all questions. Implications for accurate data collection during school-based consultation are discussed.

Experimental psychology has demonstrated a number of cognitive effects arising from exposure to neuroimaging data which may bias judgments and lead to (mis)interpretations that can affect decisions. 
We conducted a study on a sample of 62 Swiss and French judges in order to determine whether their perceptions of the credibility, quality and scientific basis of a psychiatric evaluation of a criminal defendant vary according to whether or not the evaluation includes neuroscientific data. Quantitative analyses were conducted in order to evaluate significant differences between the two conditions (one-way analyses of variance) and moderation and conditional analyses to examine whether the participants' sex and length of professional experience moderated the effect of the conditions. Terminological and thematic analyses were carried out on open questions. 
Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that the presence of neuroscience data in an expert report affects judges' perceptions of the quality, credibility, and scientificity (reliability, objectivity, scientific basis) of the report, and the persuasiveness of the evidence it provided. Moreover, this phenomenon was stronger in more experienced judges than in less experienced judges.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY,61,22,29,Web of Science,"Moulin, Valerie; Mouchet, Caroline; Pillonel, Tessa; Gkotsi, G. -M.; Baertschi, Bernard; Gasser, Jacques; Teste, Benoit",

Specifically, can visual search experts find, with uniform efficiency, any type of target in their domain of expertise? We examined whether acquired knowledge of target importance influences an expert's visual search performance. In some professional searches (e.g., medical screenings), certain targets are rare; one aim of this study was to examine the extent to which experts miss such targets in their searches. In one experiment, radiologists (medical experts) engaged in a medical lesion search task in which both the importance (i.e., seriousness/gravity) and the prevalence of targets varied. Results showed decreased target detection rates in the low prevalence conditions (i.e., the prevalence effect). Also, experts were better at detecting important (versus unimportant) lesions. Results of an experiment using novices ruled out the possibility that decreased performance with unimportant targets was due to low target noticeability/visibility. Overall, the findings suggest that radiologists do not have a generalized ability to detect any type of lesion; instead, they have acquired a specialized ability to detect only those important lesions relevant for effective medical practices.",PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG,79,729,738,Web of Science,"Nakashima, Ryoichi; Watanabe, Chisaki; Maeda, Eriko; Yoshikawa, Takeharu; Matsuda, Izuru; Miki, Soichiro; Yokosawa, Kazuhiko",

Prospective, observational study, to determine the respective contribution of clinical experience and data collection features to diagnostic accuracy. Six Internists, 6 second year internal medicine residents, and 6 senior medical students worked up the same 7 cases with a standardized patient. Each encounter was audiotaped and immediately assessed by the subjects who indicated the reasons underlying their data collection. We analyzed the encounters according to diagnostic accuracy, information collected, organ systems explored, diagnoses evaluated, and final decisions made, and we determined predictors of diagnostic accuracy by logistic regression models. Several features significantly predicted diagnostic accuracy after correction for clinical experience: early exploration of correct diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 24.35) or of relevant diagnostic hypotheses (OR 2.22) to frame clinical data collection, larger number of diagnostic hypotheses evaluated (OR 1.08), and collection of relevant clinical data (OR 1.19).

,516,X,General practicioners,Accuracy of diagnosis,Ngune,2015,Do patients treated for colorectal cancer benefit from general practitioner support? A video vignette study,"Background: Patients who have been treated for colorectal cancer in Australia can consult their general practitioner (GP) for advice about symptoms or side effects at any time following their treatment. However, there is no evidence that such patients are consistently advised by GPs, and patients experience substantial unmet need for reassurance and advice. Objective: To explore the patient management options selected by GPs to treat a set of patients describing their symptoms following treatment for colorectal cancer. Methods: This was an Internet-based survey. Participants (GPs) viewed 6 video vignettes of actors representing patients who had been treated for colorectal cancer. The actor-patients presented problems that resulted from their treatment. Participants indicated their diagnosis and stated if they would prescribe, refer, or order tests, based on that diagnosis. These responses were then rated against the management decisions for those vignettes as recommended by a team of colorectal cancer experts. Results: In total, 52 GPs consented to take part in the study, and 40 (77%) completed the study. Most GPs made a diagnosis of colorectal cancer treatment side effects/symptoms of recurrence that was consistent with the experts’ opinions. However, correct diagnosis was dependent on the type of case viewed. Compared with radiation proctitis, GPs were more likely to recognize peripheral neuropathy (odds ratio, OR, 4.43, 95% CI 1.41-13.96, P = .011) and erectile dysfunction (OR 9.70, 95% CI 2.48-38.03, P = .001), but less likely to identify chemotherapy-induced fatigue (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08-0.44). GPs who had more hours of direct patient care (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.84, P = .02), were experienced (OR 9.78, 95% CI 1.18-8.84, P = .02), and consulted more patients per week (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.16-5.30, P = .02) suggested a management plan that was consistent with the expert opinion. Conclusions: In this pilot study, years of experience and direct patient contact hours had a significant and positive impact on the management of patients. This study also showed promising results indicating that management of the common side effects of colorectal cancer treatment can be delegated to general practice. Such an intervention could support the application of shared models of care. However, a larger study, including the management of side effects in real patients, needs to be conducted before this can be safely recommended.

,517,X,Radiology trainees vs mammographers,Decision time and performance,Nodine,2002,Time course of perception and decision making during mammographic interpretation,"OBJECTIVE. This article describes the time course of lesion detection on digital mammograms using data about both eye position and decision time to compare performance between experienced mammographers and trainees. Research indicates that a longer decision time works against performance in the interpretation of chest radiographs because the likelihood of error is increased, particularly for trainees. Is this relation between decision time and performance also true for interpreting mammograms? Is there an optimal decision time-performance trade-off for detecting breast lesions? 

MATERIALS AND METHODS. Six radiology trainees (experience, 302-976 cases) and three mammographers (experience, 3000-5000 cases per year) reviewed 40 test cases. Each test case was represented by two mammograms that showed different views of the same breast. Twenty breasts contained suspicious lesions, and 20 were lesion-free. An interactive computer display system with an eye-head tracker measured the timing of decisions, where visual attention was directed, and how much time was spent fixating on a region of interest for each decision. Eye position was monitored during an initial-decision phase, and decision times were measured throughout a final-decision phase during which suspicious lesions recognized initially were interpreted and localized. Performance was analyzed using localization receiver operating characteristic curves. 

RESULTS. The time course of interpreting mammograms is similar to that for interpreting chest radiographs. Mammographers detected 71% of the true lesions within 25 sec, and trainees detected 46% within 40 sec. Both a fixation dwell time of 1000 msec and a high level of confidence in the decision were associated with the detection of true lesions for the mammographers but not for the trainees. 

CONCLUSION. Mammographers detected most breast lesions by global recognition within 25 sec, but trainees took more time. Prolonging one's search beyond the global recognition phase yielded few new lesions and increased the risk of error",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY,179,917,923,Web of Science,"Nodine, CF; Mello-Thoms, C; Kundel, HL; Weinstein, SP",

In Exp 2 ( n  = 126 business majors), 2 hypotheses are contrasted. The 1st, the availability explanation, suggests that the underestimation of the ""all-other-problems"" category stems from its label being a less effective retrieval cue for specific fault reasons than the labels of major categories.

Results suggest that people generating less failure reasons provide higher proportions to the ""all-other-problems"" category than people generating more reasons. Results of Exps 3 ( n  = 138 auto mechanics and 68 laymen) and 4 ( n  = 31 pharmacology students and 44 undergraduates) indicate that the judgments of people with relatively low levels of domain knowledge are influenced by perceived ease of recall, whereas the judgments of people with higher levels of domain knowledge are influenced by recalled evidence.

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether expert outfielders are faster than non-experts in acting on information about the flight of a fly ball. It was hypothesized that expert outfielders are better attuned to this information; as a result, faster and more accurate responses were expected. This hypothesis was tested by having non-expert and expert outfielders judge, as quickly as possible, where a ball would land in the front-behind dimension (perceptual condition) and, in another condition, to attempt to catch such balls (catching condition). The results of the perceptual condition do not support the hypothesis that expert outfielders are more sensitive to ball flight information than non-experts, but the results of the catching condition reveal that experts are more likely to initiate locomotion in the correct direction.",JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES,15,587,595,Web of Science,"Oudejans, RRD; Michaels, CF; Bakker, FC",

In particular, we (a) tested the recognition heuristic [Goldstein, D. G., &amp; Gigerenzer, G. (2002). Models of ecological rationality: the recognition heuristic. Psychological Review, 109 , 75-90], which requires partial ignorance, against four alternative mechanisms in describing laypeople's forecasts for the European Soccer Championships 2004; (b) evaluated how well recognition predicted the outcomes of the matches compared to direct indicators of team strength (e.g., past performance, rankings); and (c) studied the less-is-more effect --the phenomenon that knowing less leads to more correct forecasts than knowing more--which can occur when the recognition heuristic is used. Two groups of participants (laypeople, experts) made forecasts for the first-round matches of the tournament. Of the five candidate mechanisms, the recognition heuristic predicted laypeople's forecasts best: when applicable, it accounted for 90% of the forecasts. The recognition heuristic correctly predicted the actual winner of the matches substantially better than chance but did not achieve the accuracy of direct indicators of team strength. The experts made more correct forecasts than the laypeople. Moreover, we found no benefit of ignorance among the group of laypeople, although the conditions for a less-is-more effect specified by Goldstein and Gigerenzer were fulfilled.

This study determined the rates of detection of a 'drowning' individual by beach lifeguards, and whether scanning patterns differed between groups of lifeguards (experienced/less experienced, male/females, surf/non-surf). It was hypothesized that (1) Experienced lifeguards would perform better and produce less fixations of longer duration than inexperienced; (2) A greater detection rate would be seen in a 'biased' compared to a 'non-biased' condition; (3) There would be no differences between the surf compared to non-surf lifeguards, and male compared to female lifeguards with regard to scanning patterns or detection rates. Method: A mobile eye tracker was worn by each lifeguard (n = 69, 52 males, 17 females) as they watched 12 min of animated beach footage projected onto a screen in two conditions: a. 'Non-biased' (uniform scene). b. 'Biased' (uniform scene with presumed 'rip' on right side of screen). The lifeguards were informed that at any point during the 12 min a person may or may not disappear and to highlight if and where, a person disappeared. Unknown to the participants, a person always disappeared after 10 min at the same position within, but not between, conditions. Data were analysed using anova, t-tests and binary logistic regression. Results: Experienced lifeguards were five times (p < 0.05) more likely to detect the drowning individual than inexperienced lifeguards. There were no significant differences between the visual search patterns of the groups between 2 and 10 min. The detection rates averaged 16% in the non-biased condition and 29% in biased conditions (p < 0.1), probably because lifeguards searched more on the right of the water. Furthermore, 40% (biased) and 42% (non-biased) did not detect the person disappearing, even though they fixated in the correct location in the 3.5 s before the person completely disappeared. This suggests that some lifeguards may have fixated on, but not processed, relevant visual data ('looked at but not seen'). 25% (biased) and 36% (non-biased) of the lifeguards did not fixate in the location of the person disappearing, but were able to identify their disappearance. Conclusions: Visual search patterns used by lifeguards can be altered by instruction and detection rates improve as a consequence.

We were interested in understanding what visual information is used by elite batters and when such information is perceived by the expert through the knowledge structure that has developed for the skill. Thirty baseball players participated in two experiments as either an expert or novice batter based on experience and batting statistics. Significantly superior scores in both decision time and accuracy scores were found for expert batters. Both groups used strategic game information to set probabilities about the forthcoming pitch and significantly improve performance on that pitch. The first 80 msec (approximately 3 m of ball flight) appear important to pitch recognition. Attention to early cues provided in pitching is critical to batting performance. Experts perform faster, without sacrificing accuracy, and that batters can recognize the type of pitch within 3 m of ball flight. Further, this ability is improved with the correct setting of a probability about the forthcoming pitch. These results support the proposal for the development of sophisticated knowledge structure which can make use of particular cues in the display to guide both perception and action.

,530,X,Specialist,agreement between diagnosis and treatment,Perrier,1999,Classification and treatment of follicular thyroid neoplasms are discordant between and within medical specialties,"Background. The histologic criteria to classify follicular thyroid neoplasms are controversial. Criteria used for diagnosis and treatment varies both within and between specialty groups. This discordance makes it difficult to compare disease and management practice. This is especially problematic in issues concerning reoperations and survival. To determine the degree of disparity, we surveyed 3 groups of specialists.
Methods. A questionnaire describing 10 histologic scenarios was sent to an equal number of thyroidologists, endocrine surgeons, and endocrine pathologists. Individuals were randomly selected from rosters of 3 corresponding societies. Each item asked for a rating of a diagnosis and treatment. Questionnaires were distributed and received by facsimile, and responses were kept confidential. The response rate was 60 %.
Results, Responses were analyzed by nonparametric statistical tests. Two scenarios had significant disagreement among specialties in both diagnosis and treatment: one scenario involved the assessment of neoplasms with minimal capsular invasion; the other scenario involved Hurthle cell features. In both scenarios pathologists tended to be more conservative in assigning the term, carcinoma and recommending total thyroidectomy. Significant disagreement within specialty groups was also noted. Two other scenarios dealt with the distinction between minimally and widely invasive carcinoma; significantly, pathologists viewed tumors as less invasive.
Conclusions. This study indicates that much disparity exists among specialists in pathology, endocrinology and surgery and among experts in each of these disciplines. It highlights that there is no uniform classification. If multicenter trials to evalulate treatment options are to occur a universal classification must be accepted.",SURGERY,126,1063,1068,Web of Science,"Perrier, ND; Ituarte, PHG; Treseler, P; D'Avanzo, A; Siperstein, A; Duh, QY; Clark, OH",

When trained, experienced individuals exhibit similar behaviors; however, it has been argued that this result is not a bias, but rather, a pattern-matching process. This study provides a critical examination of this claim. It also assesses both experts' susceptibility to an outcome framing bias and the effects of varying task loads on judgment. Using a simulation of state-of-the-art ship defensive systems operated by experienced, active-duty U.S. Navy officers, we found no evidence of a framing bias, while task load had a minor, but systematic effect. The order in which information was received had a significant impact, with the effect being consistent with a judgment bias. Nonetheless, we note that pattern-matching processes, similar to those that produce inferential and reconstructive effects on memory, could also explain our results. Actual or potential applications of this research include decision support system interfaces or training programs that might be developed to reduce judgment bias.

,532,X,Expert soccer players,Reaction time,Pesce,2007,Focusing of visual attention at rest and during physical exercise in soccer players,"In this study, we investigated the focus of visual attention in expert soccer players together with the effects of acute bouts of physical exercise on performance. In two discriminative reaction time experiments, which were performed both at rest and under submaximal physical workload, visual attention was cued by means of spatial cues of different size followed by compound stimuli with local and global target features. Soccer players were slower than non-athletes in reacting to local compared with global targets, but were faster in switching from local to global attending. Thus, soccer players appear to be less skilled in local attending, but better able than non-athletes to rapidly ""zoom out'' the focus of attention. Non-athletes generally showed faster performance under physical load, as expected according to the hypothesis of exercise-induced increases in arousal and/or activation and in resource allocation.

In a video test, 58 judges rated 31 gymnasts performing a balance beam skill. I compared decision quality between judges who could perform the skill themselves on the balance beam (specific motor experience = SME) and those who could not. Those with SME showed better performance than those without SME.

In study 1, 7 judges and 12 psychiatrists participated and in study 2, 32 cases from 5 psychiatric emergency units were studied. It is hypothesized that an 'expertise bias' may explain differences between the medical and the legal expert in defining the dangerousness concept (study 1), and in assessing the seriousness of the danger (study 2). Judges define dangerousness more often as harming others, whereas psychiatrists more often include harm to self in the definition. In assessing the seriousness of the danger, experts tend to be more tolerant with regard to false negatives, as the type of behavior is more familiar to them. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.

9,543,X,assistant referees,errors and accuracy,Put,2013,Web-based training improves on-field offside decision-making performance,"Objective: The present study examined to what extent off-field offside decision-making training transfers to real-life offside situations. 

Design/methods: Eighteen Belgian assistant referees were included in the experiment. Ten assistant referees (i.e., training group) were exposed to a pre- and posttest and, in between, four off-field offside training sessions via a web-based training protocol. The remaining eight assistant referees participated in the control group and only completed the pre- and posttest. During both test sessions, which were conducted separately for each group, both an on- and off-field offside decision-making test was completed. 

Results: First, an increase in response accuracy and a decrease in flag errors were observed for the training group from pre- to posttest in both the on- and off-field offside test. Second, only the training group improved in the recall and recognition accuracy of the position of the receiving attacker at the moment of the pass. 

Conclusions: This study demonstrates that perceptual-cognitive skill training results in a positive and direct transfer to on-field offside decisions. Therefore, the structure and the content of the current training intervention mimics the perceptual difficulties of real-match situations and can help the assistant referees to mediate and enhance their offside decision-making skills, both on- and off-field.

Specialized judges surely come to know their area of law well, but specialization might also allow judges to develop better, more reliable ways of assessing cases. We assessed this question by presenting a group of specialized judges with a set of hypothetical cases designed to elicit a reliance on common heuristics that can lead judges to make poor decisions. Although the judges resisted the influence of some of these heuristics, they also expressed a clear vulnerability to others. These results suggest that specialization does not produce better judgment.

Law students (mean age 25.39 yrs) and state court judges (mean age 55.56 yrs) read vignette summaries of 2 US Supreme Court death penalty cases along with descriptions of the SS evidence contained in the Court opinions, with the evidence manipulated in this study to support or not support the death penalty. Participants rated the legal relevance, admissibility, and dispositive weight of the SS evidence. They then were asked about their attitudes about the death penalty, science and SS background, attitude about SS, and political attitudes. When SS evidence was used to make new law generally, there was a bias effect. Participants rated evidence higher when it matched their own beliefs than when it did not match their beliefs. Participants' level of SS background did not moderate or mediate the bias effects. No relationship was found between political views and evidentiary ratings or attitude about the use of SS in law, but there was a relationship between evidentiary ratings and attitudes about the use of SS in law, as well as between evidentiary ratings and attitudes about judicial interpretation.

Decisions were examined regarding whether they deviated from guidelines, how risk perceptions and risk tolerances determined decisions, and how the latter differed for knowledge groups. More knowledgeable professionals were better at discriminating levels of risk according to external correspondence criteria but committed similar errors in disjunctive probability judgments, violating internal coherence criteria. Also, higher knowledge groups relied on fewer dimensions of information than did lower knowledge groups.

Methods: A mail survey with 6 questions on staging investigations, management of low rectal cancer, lymph node harvest, surgical margins and use of adjuvant therapies was sent to all general surgeons in Canada. Appropriate responses to survey questions were defined a priori. We compared survey responses according to surgeon training (colorectal/surgical oncology v. others) and geographic region (Atlantic, Central, West). 

Results: The survey was sent to 2143 general surgeons; of the 1312 respondents, 703 treat patients with rectal cancer. Most surgeons responded appropriately to the questions regarding staging investigations (88%) and management of low rectal cancer (88%). Only 55% of surgeons correctly identified the recommended lymph node harvest as 12 or more nodes, 45% identified 5 cm as the recommended distal margin for upper rectal cancer, and 70% appropriately identified which patients should be referred for adjuvant therapy. Surgeons with subspecialty training were significantly more likely to provide correct responses to all of the survey questions than other surgeons. There was limited variation in responses according to geographic region. Subspecialty-trained surgeons and recent graduates were more likely to answer all of the survey questions correctly than other surgeons. 

Conclusion: Initiatives are needed to ensure that all surgeons who treat patients with rectal cancer, regardless of training, maintain a thorough and accurate knowledge of rectal cancer treatment issues.",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY,57,385,390,Web of Science,"Richardson, Devon P.; Porter, Geoff A.; Johnson, Paul M.",

PURPOSE: To investigate differences in clinical case representations by medical students and family doctors. In particular, the role of encapsulated knowledge in clinical case representations was investigated. METHODS: Year 2 (n = 15) and Year 4 (n = 15) medical students and family doctors (n = 15) were instructed to study carefully 2 case descriptions associated with a particular disease. After each case description participants were asked to provide a diagnosis. Subsequently, they judged whether or not a target item presented on a computer screen was related to the case description. Target items consisted of literally stated signs and symptoms, inferred encapsulated items and filler items. RESULTS: Family doctors provided more accurate diagnoses than Year 2 and Year 4 medical students. Furthermore, family doctors were faster and made fewer errors in judging the relatedness of all item types than Year 2 and 4 medical students. In particular, family doctors showed their best performance on the encapsulated items. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that encapsulated knowledge becomes increasingly more prominent as expertise develops. For experienced doctors, encapsulated concepts function as the most important building blocks of clinical case representations.

Juvenile justice clinicians (N = 109) responded to a mock psychological evaluation of a juvenile, which varied antisocial history, psychopathic personality features, and diagnosis (psychopathy, conduct disorder, or none). Psychopathic personality features and antisocial behavioral history led to higher clinician ratings of the juvenile's risk for future criminality. A psychopathy label also led to higher clinician ratings of risk, but only when there was a minimal history of antisocial behavior. No diagnostic labels influenced clinician ratings regarding treatment. Viewed alongside other research on labeling in the juvenile justice system, clinicians appear to be somewhat more responsive to mention of the psychopathy construct than are nonclinical juvenile justice professionals.

During simulated flight we measured the accuracy and latency of more and less expert pilots' decision outcomes and used eye tracking to measure their attention. We also examined whether decision outcomes and attentional strategies were influenced by properties of the cues indicating problems. Background: Errors in decision making contribute to many accidents and incidents, especially among inexperienced pilots. Although much is known about decision errors in terms of their outcomes, less is known about the cognitive processes that underlie expert differences in aviation decision making. Method: Fourteen more expert and 14 less expert pilots flew 16 flights in a simulator. Half of the flights contained a failure requiring diagnosis and action in response to the failure. Cues signaling the failures varied in how diagnostic and/or correlated they were. Results: The more expert pilots generally made better decisions in terms of speed and accuracy. Both groups made faster correct decisions when cues were high versus low in diagnosticity. Only the more expert pilots made faster correct decisions when cues were correlated. More attention was allocated to relevant cues (measured by percentage dwell time on areas of interest) when a failure was present, primarily among expert pilots. Moreover, the amount of attention to cues was associated with decision accuracy. Conclusion: The findings support the link between greater attention and more effective decision making. Application: The expert advantage in attention underlying decision outcomes may provide targets for improving pilot training.

In this study, 57 experienced hotel revenue managers in Israel tested two interface attributes that affected the way revenue managers adjusted the computer's forecast. Using a four-cell typology, the test involved pairing the computer's speed (fast or slow) with whether the computer did or did not show the status of its calculations (graph of calculations or no graph). All other data were presented identically as requested by the users and all revenue-management projections were identical. One might expect that experienced managers would base their decisions on data alone, but the study indicated that the nature of the interface swayed the extent to which managers adjusted the computer's forecast.

This study compared the impact of modal and non-modal electronic (e-) prescribing alerts on prescribing error rates, to help inform the design of clinical decision support systems. Design A randomized study of 24 junior doctors each performing 30 simulated prescribing tasks in random order with a prototype e-prescribing system. Using a within-participant design, doctors were randomized to be shown one of three types of e-prescribing alert (modal, non-modal, no alert) during each prescribing task. Measurements The main outcome measure was prescribing error rate. Structured interviews were performed to elicit participants' preferences for the prescribing alerts and their views on clinical decision support systems. Results Participants exposed to modal alerts were 11.6 times less likely to make a prescribing error than those not shown an alert (OR 11.56, 95% CI 6.00 to 22.26). Those shown a non-modal alert were 3.2 times less likely to make a prescribing error (OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.91 to 5.30) than those not shown an alert. The error rate with non-modal alerts was 3.6 times higher than with modal alerts (95% CI 1.88 to 7.04). Conclusions Both kinds of e-prescribing alerts significantly reduced prescribing error rates, but modal alerts were over three times more effective than non-modal alerts.

9,573,X,ECG experts ,Number of errors ,Sibbald,2013,Checklists improve experts' diagnostic decisions,"Context: Checklists are commonly proposed tools to reduce error. However, when applied by experts, checklists have the potential to increase cognitive load and result in â€˜expertise reversalâ€™. One potential solution is to use checklists in the verification stage, rather than in the initial interpretation stage of diagnostic decisions. This may avoid expertise reversal by preserving the expertsâ€™ initial approach. Whether checklist use during the verification stage of diagnostic decision making improves expertsâ€™ diagnostic decisions is unknown. Methods: Fifteen experts interpreted 18 electrocardiograms (ECGs) in four different conditions: undirected interpretation; verification without a checklist; verification with a checklist, and interpretation combined with verification with a checklist. Outcomes included the number of errors, cognitive load, interpretation time and interpretation length. Outcomes were compared in two analyses: (i) a comparison of verification conditions with and without a checklist, and (ii) a comparison of all four conditions. Standardised scores for each outcome were used to calculate the efficiency of a checklist and to weigh its relative benefit against its relative cost in terms of cognitive load imposed, interpretation time and interpretation length. Results: In both analyses, checklist use was found to reduce error (more errors were corrected in verification conditions with checklists [0.29 Â± 0.77 versus 0.03 Â± 0.61 errors per ECG], and fewer net errors occurred in all conditions with checklists [0.39 Â± 1.14 versus 1.04 Â± 1.49 errors per ECG]; p &lt; 0.01 for both). Checklists were not associated with increased cognitive load (verifications with and without checklists: 3.7 Â± 1.9 and 3.3 Â± 2.0, respectively; conditions with and without checklists: 4.0 Â± 1.8 versus 3.9 Â± 2.0, respectively [p = not significant for both]). Checklists resulted in greater interpretation times and lengths (p &lt; 0.01 for all). However, checklists were efficient in terms of the cognitive load invested, interpretation time and interpretation length (p &lt; 0.01 for all). Conclusions: Among ECG interpretation experts, checklist use during the verification stage of diagnostic decisions did not increase cognitive load or cause expertise reversal, but did reduce diagnostic error.

Performance accuracy and fingering consistency were both correlated positively with expertise and negatively with the calculated difficulty of fingerings according to the model.

The external validity of accuracy research depends on the relevance of these expert estimates to true performance. In our study, we provided expert raters with enhanced opportunities to view videotapes of five ratees under conditions of high true dimension intercorrelation or low true intercorrelation. The accuracy of expert ratings was compared with the accuracy of nonexpert ratings of the same tapes viewed under more typical rating conditions. Subjects' ratings were compared with ratee true scores defined in terms of objective worker output. Results indicated that experts were more accurate than nonexperts, regardless of the true dimension intercorrelations. Accuracy indices computed by using objective true scores were highly correlated with indices computed by using the mean expert ratings as true score estimates.

Kentucky . 476 U.S. 79 (1986). Batson 's, prohibition against race-based peremptories was based on two assumptions: (1) a prospective juror's race can bias jury selection judgments; (2) requiring attorneys to justify suspicious peremptories enables judges to determine whether a challenge is, indeed, race-neutral. The present investigation examines these assumptions through an experimental design using three participant populations: college students, advanced law students, and practicing attorneys. Results demonstrate that race does influence peremptory use, but these judgments are typically justified in race-neutral terms that effectively mask the biasing effects of race. The psychological processes underlying these tendencies are discussed, as are practical implications for the legal system.

The authors examined whether such changes could partly explain improvement on tasks such as perception of medical X-ray images. Experiment 1 found experts' sensitivity to low-contrast dots in X-rays was better than novices'. Experiment 2 found a direction of luminance contrast-specific improvement in novices' detection of low-contrast dots in X-rays as a result of practice. Experiment 3 found a partly specific improvement in novices' detection of low-contrast features in real medical X-rays as a result of practice. Results suggest that experience enhances sensitivity to the critical dimensions of visual analysis for detecting abnormalities in X-ray images.

In total, 54 elite-level endurance cyclists (10 women and 44 men) were manipulated to endorse a limited (susceptible to depletion) or nonlimited (unsusceptible to depletion) implicit belief about decision-making ability. Results showed that after the manipulation cyclists assigned to the limited resource condition had higher levels of limited beliefs and lower levels of nonlimited beliefs than those assigned to the nonlimited resource condition. Those in the limited resource condition also showed a decrease in decision-making performance, whereas those in the nonlimited resource condition showed an increase in decision-making performance.

Eight skilled and ten less-skilled right-handed batsmen each viewed 100 in-swing, 100 out-swing, and 40 slower deliveries displayed in random sequence from projected video footage whilst their responses and electroencephalograms were recorded. Logistic regression was used to derive a discriminative function for the P300 data. This was done to determine whether the skilled batsmen differed from the less-skilled batsmen on the basis of pooled P300 amplitude and latency data. All the batsmen were correctly characterised as being skilled or less-skilled. Logistic regression equations with reaction time and correctness of response data indicated that behavioural data do not correctly classify skilled performance. It is suggested that skilled cricket batsmen have a superior perceptual decision-making ability compared with less-skilled cricket batsmen, as measured by P300 latency and amplitude. This appears to be the first study showing a link between skill and cerebral cortical activity during a perceptual cricket batting task and it could pave the way for future studies on mental processing in cricket batsmen.

Good judgements and reduced variations in practice require nurses to identify relevant ""signals"" in clinical encounters. Nurses, even experienced ones, vary in their ability to separate these signals from surrounding noise. Objectives: Examine specialist and generalist nursesâ€™ discrimination of clinical signals and noise when (i) diagnosing venous versus other causes leg ulceration, and (ii) starting multilayer compression therapy. Design: A signal detection analysis within a cross sectional survey. Settings: Four English NHS districts. Participants: Tissue viability specialist ( n = 18) and generalist (district and practice nurses, n = 18) sampled from networks of nurses caring for people with leg ulcers. Mean age was 46 years, 78% had more than 10 years nursing experience. They worked on average 32.5h per week, of which 10h were spent caring for people with leg ulcers. Methods: 110 clinical scenarios based on anonymous patient data from a large clinical trial of compression therapy for leg ulceration. The scenarios were classed as either signal (venous leg ulcer present and/or compression therapy warranted, n = 57) or no signal cases (other kind of ulcer and/or compression therapy contraindicated, n = 53) by four experts. Nurses made diagnostic and treatment judgements for each scenario. A signal detection analysis was undertaken for each nurse. Measures of signal detection ( d prime or dâ€² ) and judgement tendency or bias (C) were computed. Differences between specialist and generalist nurses were tested for using the Mann Whitney U test and graphically explored using Receiver Operating Curves (ROC). Results: Specialists identified more true positive cases than the generalist nurses: 75% vs. 59% for the diagnostic judgement ( p &lt;0.01) and 70% vs. 60% for the treatment judgement. They were significantly more sensitive to the signals present (dâ€² 1.68 vs. 1.08 for the diagnostic judgement and 1.62 vs. 1.11 for the treatment judgement). Specialists exhibited a significantly higher bias towards initiating treatment ( C = .81 vs. .56, p &lt;0.01) but this did not extend to their diagnostic judgements. Specialists also varied slightly less in their signal detection abilities. Conclusions: Nurse specialism was associated with better, but still variable, clinical diagnostic and treatment signal detection in simulated venous leg ulcer management.

People with genuine expertise in a particular domain can perform quickly and accurately, and with little information. In the series of experiments presented here, we manipulate the amount of ""information'' available to a group of experts whose job it is to identify the source of crime scene fingerprints. In Experiment 1, we reduced the amount of information available to experts by inverting fingerprint pairs and adding visual noise. There was no evidence for an inversion effect-experts were just as accurate for inverted prints as they were for upright prints-but expert performance with artificially noisy prints was impressive. In Experiment 2, we separated matching and nonmatching print pairs in time. Experts were conservative, but they were still able to discriminate pairs of fingerprints that were separated by five-seconds, even though the task was quite different from their everyday experience. In Experiment 3, we separated the print pairs further in time to test the long-term memory of experts compared to novices. Long-term recognition memory for experts and novices was the same, with both performing around chance. In Experiment 4, we presented pairs of fingerprints quickly to experts and novices in a matching task. Experts were more accurate than novices, particularly for similar nonmatching pairs, and experts were generally more accurate when they had more time. It is clear that experts can match prints accurately when there is reduced visual information, reduced opportunity for direct comparison, and reduced time to engage in deliberate reasoning. These findings suggest that non-analytic processing accounts for a substantial portion of the variance in expert fingerprint matching accuracy. Our conclusion is at odds with general wisdom in fingerprint identification practice and formal training, and at odds with the claims and explanations that are offered in court during expert testimony.",PLOS ONE,9,,,Web of Science,"Thompson, Matthew B.; Tangen, Jason M.",

This study examined differences in decision-making time and accuracy as attributes of speed discrimination between participants skilled and less skilled in ball games. A total of 130 men, ages 18 to 28 years (M = 21.2, SD = 2.6), participated. The athlete sample (skilled group) comprised Estonian National League volleyball (n = 26) and basketball players (n 27), The nonathlete sample (less skilled group) included 77 soldiers of the Estonian Defence: Force with no reported top level experience in ball games. Speed-discrimination stimuli were images of red square shapes presented moving along the sagittal axis at four different virtual velocities on a computer (PC) screen which represented the frontal plane. Analysis indicated that only decision-making time was significantly different between the elite athlete and nonathlete groups. This finding suggests a possible effect of ball-game skills for decision-making time in speed discrimination.

Participants performed 5 dual tasks that represented different degrees of structural similarity as characterized by the structure-specific resource model. Age, expertise, and structural similarity were found to interactively affect time-sharing performance through attentional resources. Age-related deficits in time-sharing were evident under conditions of intense attentional demands and when precise control was required. Modest expertise modulation of the age effects is likely to increase with more domain-specific time-sharing. The structure-specific resource model provided a useful framework for interpreting the relationship between aging and time-sharing performance.

The National Research Council of the National Academies and the legal and forensic sciences communities have called for research to measure the accuracy and reliability of latent print examiners’ decisions, a challenging and complex problem in need of systematic analysis. Our research is focused on the development of empirical approaches to studying this problem. Here, we report on the first large-scale study of the accuracy and reliability of latent print examiners’ decisions, in which 169 latent print examiners each compared approximately 100 pairs of latent and exemplar fingerprints from a pool of 744 pairs. The fingerprints were selected to include a range of attributes and quality encountered in forensic casework, and to be comparable to searches of an automated fingerprint identification system containing more than 58 million subjects. This study evaluated examiners on key decision points in the fingerprint examination process; procedures used operationally include additional safeguards designed to minimize errors. Five examiners made false positive errors for an overall false positive rate of 0.1%. Eighty-five percent of examiners made at least one false negative error for an overall false negative rate of 7.5%. Independent examination of the same comparisons by different participants (analogous to blind verification) was found to detect all false positive errors and the majority of false negative errors in this study. Examiners frequently differed on whether fingerprints were suitable for reaching a conclusion.

Diagnostic suggestions may evoke such confirmatory tendencies in physicians, which may lead to diagnostic errors. PURPOSE: This study investigated the influence of a suggested diagnosis on physicians' diagnostic decisions on written clinical cases. It was hypothesized that physicians would tend to go along with the suggestions and therefore would have more difficulty rejecting incorrect suggestions than accepting correct suggestions. METHODS: Residents (N = 24) had to accept or reject suggested diagnoses on 6 cases. Three of those suggested diagnoses were correct, and 3 were incorrect. RESULTS: Results showed the mean correct evaluation score on cases with a correct suggested diagnosis (M = 2.21, SD = 0.88) was significantly higher than the score on cases with an incorrect suggested diagnosis (M = 1.42, SD = 0.97), meaning physicians indeed found it easier to accept correct diagnoses than to reject incorrect diagnoses, t(23) = 2.74, p < .05, d = .85, despite equal experience with the diagnoses.

The vignettes varied in terms of whether the defendant spoke English or Spanish, and whether his mental illness symptoms were obvious or ambiguous. Overall, attorneys rated the Spanish-speaking defendant as less mentally ill than the English-speaking defendant, and were less likely to refer the Spanish-speaking defendant for a CST evaluation. Attorneys who perceived more logistical barriers to seeking a CST evaluation in their local communities were less likely to refer the defendant for a CST evaluation, but only when the defendant spoke Spanish. These findings suggest attorney decisions were influenced by language, although further research is needed to identify the mechanism of this influence.

Experts (mean FT = 78%) differed significantly from near experts (mean FT = 56%) in having a longer fixation on the target combined with an earlier fixation offset during the shooting action. These results, which depart from current models of near aiming, are tentatively explained using a location-suppression hypothesis. During the early phases of the aiming action, a fixation of long duration is needed on a specific target location. As the aiming action is then performed, vision appears to be a liability and is suppressed.

A total of 120 mock suspects told the truth or lied about a staged event and were interviewed by a police officer employing one of these three interview styles. The results showed that accusatory interviews, which typically result in suspects making short denials, contained the fewest verbal cues to deceit. Moreover, RM distinguished between truth tellers and liars better than CBCA. Finally, manual RM coding resulted in more verbal cues to deception than automatic coding of the RM criteria utilising the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software programme. In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of the three police interview styles on the ability to detect deception. Sixty-eight police officers watched some of the videotaped interviews of Experiment 1 and made veracity and confidence judgements. Accuracy scores did not differ between the three interview styles; however, watching accusatory interviews resulted in more false accusations (accusing truth tellers of lying) than watching information-gathering interviews. Furthermore, only in accusatory interviews, judgements of mendacity were associated with higher confidence. We discuss the possible danger of conducting accusatory interviews.

In this study, 132 judges from three states read a murder case summary, evaluated the defendant's guilt, assessed the voluntariness of his confession, and responded to implicit and explicit measures of harmless error. Results indicated that judges found a high-pressure confession to be coerced and hence improperly admitted into evidence. As in studies with mock jurors, however, the improper confession significantly increased their conviction rate in the absence of other evidence.

,618,X,students vs clinicians vs experts,decision-making abilities,Walters,1988,Use of the MMPI to identify malingering and exaggeration of psychiatric symptomatology in male prison inmates,"In the first of two studies it was determined that special Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scales (e.g., the Dissimulation scale and the Obvious and Subtle subscales) were slightly more effective in discriminating between malingering and genuinely disturbed male prison inmates ( N  = 72) relative to the standard MMPI validity and clinical scales. The second study in this series evaluated the decision-making abilities of students ( N  = 20), clinicians ( N  = 16), and experts ( N  = 24) using MMPIs generated by a subsample of inmates from Study 1. Clinical judges did no better, and in many cases did worse, than the actuarials obtained in Study 1. Furthermore, prior clinical experience, training, and perceived expertise had little impact on performance. Judges utilizing a linear or a combined linear-configural interpretive approach did slightly better than judges relying exclusively on configural strategies. Surprisingly, many of the clinical judges seemed to experience difficulty making effective use of base-rate information.

,619,X,Grad students vs freshmen,Constructive biases,Walther,2003,The influence of prior knowledge on constructive biases,"Two experimental studies investigated the influence of prior knowledge on constructive judgments. In Study 1, individuals with high expertise (graduate students) and individuals with low expertise (freshmen) were required to answer questions about a target's mania before they were asked to judge the target on several rating scales including mania. Results indicated that merely thinking about the mania questions resulted in stronger constructive biases (i.e., higher mania ratings) in experts as compared to non-experts. This effect occurred even when participants correctly rejected the question content as false. Study 2, in which knowledge structures were varied experimentally, replicated these findings.

9,620,X,Managers,Decision to hire,Wang,2010,Making those who cannot see look best: Effects of visual resume formatting on ratings of job applicants with blindness,"Objective: Although general attitudes toward individuals with disabilities are often positive, these perceptions do not always lead to equal footing in the hiring process. This study examined stereotypes of job applicants perceived to be blind and the role of applicant blindness in hireability ratings made by human resource managers. Specifically, we highlighted a unique challenge for individuals who cannot see: the visual formatting of resumes. Design: Human resource managers ( N = 249) evaluated the visually formatted or unformatted resumes of hypothetical job applicants who were portrayed as blind or sighted and rated applicant hireability and personality characteristics. Results: Although applicants perceived to be blind were perceived as more conscientious and agreeable by human resource managers, these positive evaluations did not translate into favorable hireability evaluations. Conclusion: Because human resource managers severely penalize applicants who do not attend to visual, nonfunctional resume presentation, applicants who cannot see are apt to find themselves disadvantaged in the hiring process. The implications of these findings for organizations, job seekers, and rehabilitation professionals are discussed.

The present study compares credibility ratings by Norwegian court judges with those made by lay people. The participants viewed one of three video-recorded versions of a rape victim's statement, role played by a professional actress. The statement was given in a free-recall manner with one of three kinds of emotions displayed, termed congruent, neutral, and incongruent emotional expression. The results show that, in contrast to lay people, the credibility ratings of court judges and their votes for a guilty verdict were not influenced by the emotions displayed by the witness.

This paper resports on experiments which sought evidence of automation in two programming subtasks, recognition of syntactic errors and understanding of the structure and function of simple stereotyped code segments. Novice and expert programmers made a series of timed decisions about short, textbook-type program segments. It was found that, in spite of the simplicity of the materials, experts were significantly faster and more accurate than novices. This supports the idea that experts automate some simple subcomponents of the programming task. This automation has potential implications for the teaching of programming, the evaluation of programmers, and programming language design.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MAN-MACHINE STUDIES,23,383,390,Web of Science,"WIEDENBECK, S",

Experienced (n = 12) and less experienced (n = 12) soccer players moved in response to filmed offensive sequences. Experiment 1 examined differences in search strategy between the two groups, using an eye movement registration system. Experienced players demonstrated superior anticipation in 3-on-3 and 1-on-1 soccer simulations. There were no differences in search strategy in 3-on-3 situations. In 1-on-1 simulations, the experienced players had a higher search rate, involving more fixations of shorter duration, and fixated for longer on the hip region, indicating that this area was important in anticipating an opponent's movements. Experiment 2 examined the relationship between visual fixation and selective attention, using a spatial occlusion approach. In 3-on-3 situations, masking information ""pick up"" from areas other than the ball or ball passer had a more detrimental effect on the experienced players' performances, suggesting differences in selective attention. In 1-on-1 situations, occluding an oncoming dribbler's head and shoulders, hips, or lower leg and ball region did not affect the experienced players' performance more than the less experienced group. The disparities in search strategy observed in Experiment 1 did not directly relate to differences in information extraction. Experiment 3 used concurrent verbal reports to indicate where participants extracted information from while viewing 3-on-3 sequences. Experienced players spent less time attending to the ball or ball passer and more time on other areas of the display. Findings highlight the advantages of integrating eye movements with more direct measures of selective attention.",RESEARCH QUARTERLY FOR EXERCISE AND SPORT,69,111,128,Web of Science,"Williams, AM; Davids, K",
9,630,X,Primary care doctors,Doctor test ordering behaviour,Windak,2010,The competence of primary care doctors in the investigation of patients with elevated blood pressure: results of a cross-sectional study using clinical vignettes,"Background 

Specific laboratory tests are required to ensure adequate management of patients with hypertension, according to internationally accepted guidelines. There is wide variation in doctor test ordering behaviour. Many factors are known to affect this. Little is known about the interaction between doctor, patient and practice characteristics. The current study was designed to explore this. 

Methods 

A series of eight case vignettes was designed to examine test ordering behaviour among primary care doctors in Poland. The cases differed with regard to the level of blood pressure and the presence or absence of other cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes. Doctors stated their choices of laboratory investigations needed in these cases. Their responses were compared with recommendations in the 2003 European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology hypertension guidelines. Associations between the correct responses and patient, doctor and practice characteristics were tested. 

Results 

One hundred and twenty-five out of 192 invited doctors (65%) participated in the study. They ordered a mean of 4.9 laboratory tests per case. This represents 47.9% of the tests recommended by current guidelines. Older doctors working in smaller practices and private settings ordered fewer laboratory tests. Specialization in family medicine was associated with greater compliance with guidelines. Grade 2 hypertension and the presence of other risk factors of cardiovascular disease were associated with ordering more tests but the presence of diabetes did not improve compliance with guidelines. 

Conclusions 

Further educational efforts are needed to promote rational test ordering for hypertensive patients by Polish primary health care doctors.",JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE,16,784,789,Web of Science,"Windak, Adam; Gryglewska, Barbara; Tomasik, Tomasz; Narkiewicz, Krzysztof; Yaphe, John; Grodzicki, Tomasz",

We found an intermediate effect in diagnosticians' decision time and correctness: Intermediates performed worse and faster than both novices and very experienced clinicians. In line with most other studies, we found that experienced diagnosticians were not significantly more accurate than novices.

,635,X,medical students & emergency medics,diagnostic decisions,Woods,2015,Expertise and decision-making in American football,"Background: The primary aim of this study is to understand more about the perceptual-cognitive mechanisms underpinning the expert advantage in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation. While research has examined visual search processes in other aspects of medical decision making (e.g., radiology), this is the first study to apply the paradigm to ECG interpretation. The secondary aim is to explore the role that clinical history plays in influencing visual search behavior and diagnostic decision making. While clinical history may aid diagnostic decision making, it may also bias the visual search process. Methods: Ten final-year medical students and 10 consultant emergency medics were presented with 16 ECG traces (8 with clinical history that was not manipulated independently of case) while wearing eye tracking equipment. The ECGs represented common abnormalities encountered in emergency departments and were among those taught to final-year medical students. Participants were asked to make a diagnosis on each presented trace and report their level of diagnostic confidence. Results: Experts made significantly faster, more accurate, and more confident diagnoses, and this advantage was underpinned by differences in visual search behavior. Specifically, experts were significantly quicker at locating the leads of critical importance. Contrary to our hypothesis, clinical history had no significant effect on the readers' ability to detect the abnormality or make an accurate diagnosis. Conclusions: Accurate ECG interpretation appears dependent on the perceptual skill of pattern recognition and specifically the time to fixate the critical lead(s). Therefore, there is potential clinical utility in developing perceptual training programs to train novices to detect abnormalities more effectively.",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,6,,,Web of Science,"Woods, Adam J.; Kranjec, Alexander; Lehet, Matt; Chatterjee, Anjan",
,636,X,Medical students vs residents vs experts,Performance,Young,2007,How residents think and make medical decisions: Implications for education and patient safety,"Background. ""Failure to Rescue"" is a term applied to clinical issues that, if unrecognized or improperly treated, lead to adverse outcomes. We examined the cognitive components of rescue through the use of a ""War Games"" simulator format. Our hypothesis was that junior and senior medical students would be less able than interns and residents to detail the actions needed to assess, intervene, and stabilize patients.
Methods. Medical students and residents rotating on the trauma and surgical intensive care unit service participated. Twelve scenarios were created to focus on basic floor emergencies. Scores were assigned for clinical actions ordered. The scenarios were validated by two critical care attending physicians, and these scores were used as the expert group. Scores were assigned by two examiners, and the average of the grades in each area was used. The scores are a ratio of actual to possible correct responses in each section, and in the entire exercise.
Results. Subjects were divided into third-year medical students (MS3), fourth-year students (MS4), first-year residents (PGY1), residents beyond their first year (PGY2+), and experts. There were 20 subjects and 5 experts (n = 85) in each group for a total of 140 simulated cases examined. On initial evaluation, MS4 and PGY2+ performed significantly worse than expert, and MS3 and PGY1 performed similarly to experts. On secondary evaluation, all groups performed significantly worse than the expert group. In determining the diagnosis, only MS3 differed significantly from the experts. On follow-up, and in total score, all performed significantly worse than the experts.
Discussion. All groups had significant deficits in cognitive performance compared with experts in the areas of secondary evaluation, follow-up of the presenting problem, and total performance in simple clinical scenarios. We must design educational systems that rapidly enhance the cognitive performance of students and residents before they are left to independently diagnose and intervene in life-threatening clinical situations.

This study examined the basic science of the cognitive performance of trainees. We created a low-intensity medical simulator to perform a preliminary study of the ability of residents to recall and process patient information presented verbally. The subjects were separated into three categories based on critical care experience: novice (<= 8 weeks of critical care experience), intermediate (8-16 weeks of critical care experience), and expert (> 16 weeks of critical care experience). The subjects were presented with three clinical cases. In the first case, the presentation contained 55 separate data points and subject recall was analyzed. In the second and third cases, a patient report was given, and the subjects were asked by a ""medical student"" to outline and explain their treatment decisions. Fifteen subjects completed the experiment (five novices, six intermediates, and four experts). Case 1 (recall): No significant differences among groups with regard to errors or total data points recalled (however, subjects who chose not to take notes had significantly poorer recall and committed more errors). Cases 2 and 3 (cognition and decision making): Intermediates and experts made significantly fewer errors. More importantly, the reasoning process (forward hypothesis based) of the more experienced residents differed from novices. This preliminary study demonstrates that the cognitive processes used by residents experienced in critical care are quantitatively and qualitatively different from those used by novices. These processes were also associated with far fewer cognitive errors in clinical decision making.

,R151,,,,Meissner,2002,"""He's guilty!"": Investigator bias in judgments of truth and deception","Detecting deception is an inherently difficult task, but one that plays a critical role for law enforcement investigators in the interrogation room. In general, research has failed to indicate that performance in this domain is improved by training or prior experience. A signal detection framework is applied to the paradigm to better conceptualize the influence of these two factors. The authors found that although neither factor influenced discrimination accuracy, there was an effect on response bias such that training and prior experience appeared to increase the likelihood of responding ""deceit"" as opposed to ""truth."" This ""investigator bias"" was observed both in a review of the literature and in this study of North American law enforcement investigators who took part in a forensically based deception-detection task. Possible theoretical mechanisms and practical implications of these findings are discussed.
